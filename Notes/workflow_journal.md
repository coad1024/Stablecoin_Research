# Stablecoin Research Workflow Journal

## Date: 2025-09-08

## **Objective**
To analyze the economic feasibility of a de-peg attack on an algorithmic stablecoin and propose effective mitigation measures to prevent or minimize its impact.

## **Goal**
1. **Understand De-Pegging**: Research past de-peg events and identify key factors contributing to such scenarios.
2. **Model Attack Feasibility**: Develop a framework to calculate the cost of executing a de-peg attack versus the potential profit for the attacker.
3. **Propose Mitigation Measures**: Design and evaluate mechanisms to prevent de-pegging or reduce its impact, including circuit breakers, enhanced liquidity reserves, and real-time monitoring systems.
4. **Document Findings**: Summarize the analysis, modeling, and proposed solutions in a clear and concise markdown file with supporting diagrams and data insights.

## **Workflow**

### Tasks Completed
- Set up folder structure for stablecoin research
- Added arxiv stablecoin scraper script to Tools
- Planned resource collection and analysis workflow
- Extracted titles from arxiv_stablecoin_papers.csv for analysis

### Scripts/Tools Used
- arxiv_stablecoin_scraper.py (arXiv API metadata scraper)
- Rainbow CSV for viewing and aligning CSV data
- Manual extraction of titles for further processing

### Insights & Challenges
- arXiv API provides useful metadata for academic papers
- Need to regularly update resource collection as new papers are published
- Titles extracted successfully for further analysis
- CSV file contains detailed metadata, which can be leveraged for deeper insights

### Next Steps
- Analyze collected papers and blogs
- Summarize findings in Analysis folder
- Continue documenting workflow and insights in this journal
- Perform analysis on extracted titles
- Use insights to categorize and summarize stablecoin research
- Document findings in the Analysis folder
