    Represents a token within an algorithmic stablecoin model, such as the Terra/Luna model.
    This class allows for minting (increasing the supply) and burning (decreasing the supply) of tokens
    in response to changes in market conditions, helping to maintain the peg to a stable value.

    In this model, one token (the stablecoin) is kept at a stable price, while the other (the 
    'collateral token') adjusts in supply to balance the system and maintain the peg.

    Attributes:
        name (str): The name of the token.
        _supply (float): The current total supply of the token.
        _free_supply (float): The amount of tokens present in users' wallets.
