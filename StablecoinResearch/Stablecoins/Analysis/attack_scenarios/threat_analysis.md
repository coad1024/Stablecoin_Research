### Market Condition Dependencies

#### **Normal Market Conditions**
```
User Behavior: μ=0, σ=0.001×L (calm trading)
Arbitrage Response: 70% probability, 80% restoration
Attack Success Rate: 25% (reduced due to active arbitrage)
```

**Defensive Advantages:**
- Active arbitrage capital deployed
- Normal user trading patterns
- Stable liquidity provision

#### **Panic Market Conditions**
```
User Behavior: μ=-0.005×L, σ=0.02×L (panic selling)

- Arbitrage capital may be tied up elsewhere
- Liquidity providers may exit

#### **Extreme Stress Conditions**
```
User Behavior: μ=-0.01×L, σ=0.05×L (extreme panic)
Arbitrage Response: 30% probability, 40% restoration
Attack Success Rate: 65% (highly favorable)
```

**Attack Advantages:**

- Arbitrage overwhelmed or withdrawn
- Liquidity evaporates rapidly

### Threshold Analysis

#### **Capital Requirement Thresholds**

| Pool Size | 25% Success | 50% Success | 75% Success |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| $1M       | 3%          | 7%          | 15%         |
| $5M       | 3%          | 7%          | 15%         |
| $10M      | 3%          | 7%          | 15%         |
| $50M      | 3%          | 7%          | 15%         |

**Key Finding**: Thresholds remain consistent across pool sizes (percentage-based)

#### **Time Window Analysis**

**Attack Window (Optimal Timing):**
- **Market Hours**: Reduced arbitrage on weekends
- **Geographic**: Target off-hours for major arbitrage centers
- **Event-Driven**: During broader market stress/crisis
- **Technical**: During network congestion periods

2. **Arbitrage Speed**: Fast vs slow response (20% vs 60% success)
3. **User Behavior**: Panic amplification crucial
4. **Attack Coordination**: Professional vs amateur execution

#### **Secondary Success Factors (Moderate Impact)**

**Setup:**
- **Arbitrage**: 99% probability, 95% restoration
- **User Behavior**: Calm markets (normal regime)
- **Liquidity**: Deep, committed LP positions
- **Monitoring**: Real-time attack detection

**Attack Success Rate**: <5%
**Implementation Cost**: 15-20% of pool depth
**Sustainability**: Requires ongoing investment

#### **Scenario E: "Minimal Defense"**

**Setup:**
- **Arbitrage**: 30% probability, 40% restoration
- **User Behavior**: No panic prevention
- **Liquidity**: Mercenary, exits during stress

**Attack Success Rate**: 70%+
**Implementation Cost**: Minimal
**Risk Level**: Unacceptable for stable operation

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

#### **Technical Countermeasures**
1. **Circuit Breakers**: Automatic trading halts
2. **Dynamic Pricing**: Curve adjustments during attacks
3. **Time Delays**: Withdrawal waiting periods
4. **MEV Protection**: Front-running prevention

#### **Economic Countermeasures**
