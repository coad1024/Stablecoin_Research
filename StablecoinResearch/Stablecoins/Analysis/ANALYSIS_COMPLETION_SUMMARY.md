  - Original vs Refined model architectures  
  - Parameter specifications and validation
  - Implementation challenges and solutions
  - Performance characteristics and scalability

### üí∞ **Economic Analysis** (`economic_analysis/`)
- **`profit_mechanisms.md`** - Comprehensive economic evaluation
  - Capital requirements (conservative vs realistic)
  - ROI calculations and expected value analysis
  - Attack incentive structures and risk-reward profiles
  - Market impact and liquidity provision economics

### üéØ **Attack Scenarios** (`attack_scenarios/`)
- **`threat_analysis.md`** - Comprehensive threat modeling
  - Threat actor classification (institutional, retail, state)
  - Attack vector analysis (AMM dump, flash loans, leverage, options)
  - Scenario-specific execution plans and success probabilities
  - Market condition dependencies and threshold analysis

### üìä **Comparative Study** (`comparative_study/`)
- **`model_comparison.md`** - Cross-model validation analysis
  - Quantitative consistency validation (40-52% vs 40% success rates)
  - Methodological trade-offs and selection guidelines
  - Combined model strategy for academic and practical use
  - Future research directions and validation framework

### üé® **Visualizations** (`visualizations/`)
- **3 Publication-ready figures** copied from refined model:
  - `Figure1_Main_Heatmap.png` - Primary results (40% failure rates)
  - `Figure2_Time_Series.png` - Attack dynamics illustration  
  - `Figure3_Model_Validation.png` - Academic credibility proof
- **`README.md`** - Complete visualization portfolio guide

## üéØ **Key Findings Synthesized**

### **Primary Research Contribution**
**40% attack success rate with 5-10% of pool depth** under panic conditions - first rigorous quantification of algorithmic stablecoin vulnerability

### **Economic Impact Assessment**
**$47K - $912K profit potential** with modest capital requirements, creating strong incentives for sophisticated attacks

### **Policy Implications**
**Scale independence** - larger liquidity pools don't provide proportional protection, requiring regulatory framework updates

### **Technical Validation**
**Dual-model consistency** - original sophisticated (40-52%) and refined academic (40%) models converge on key findings
