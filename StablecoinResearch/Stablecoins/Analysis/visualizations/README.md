# Visualization Portfolio: De-peg Attack Analysis

## Publication-Ready Figures

### üéØ **Figure 1: Main Results Heatmap** 
**File:** `Figure1_Main_Heatmap.png`

**Purpose:** Primary research finding - attack success rates by pool size and attack magnitude

**Key Insights:**
- 40% failure probability with 5-10% pool attacks
- Pool size provides limited protection (scale independence)
- Clear quantitative thresholds for regulatory consideration

**Usage:** 
- **Academic Papers:** Primary results figure
- **Policy Briefs:** Executive summary visualization
- **Presentations:** Opening slide for impact

**Caption:** "Peg Failure Probability Under Coordinated Attack. Heatmap showing failure probability as a function of pool depth and attack size under panic market conditions with moderate arbitrage response. Results demonstrate that modest attacks (5-10% of pool depth) achieve 40% failure probability regardless of pool size."

- Critical role of arbitrage timing in determining outcomes
- Hour-scale dynamics suitable for intervention planning

**Usage:**
- **Academic Papers:** Methodology illustration
- **Technical Presentations:** Mechanism explanation
- **Risk Training:** Visual example of attack progression

**Caption:** "Representative Attack Dynamics: Failure vs Recovery Scenarios. Time-series traces showing stablecoin price evolution over 50 hours for identical parameters but different stochastic outcomes, illustrating the binary nature of attack outcomes and critical role of arbitrage timing."

- Theoretical thresholds confirmed empirically

**Usage:**
- **Academic Papers:** Methods validation section
- **Peer Review:** Credibility establishment
- **Technical Audits:** Model accuracy verification

**Caption:** "Model Validation: Analytic vs Simulated Price Impact. Comparison between theoretical constant-product AMM price impact and simulated minimum prices achieved, validating that stochastic simulation accurately captures underlying AMM mechanics while incorporating realistic market dynamics."
