An Abstract Category of Dynamical Systems,James Schmidt,2023-12-14T21:05:40Z,A notion of time is fundamental in the study of dynamical systems. Time arises as a standalone dynamical system and also in solutions or trajectories as a special kind of map between systems.

Reviving networked multi-dimensional dynamical systems,"Nan Dong, An Zeng, Honggang Li",2025-02-20T13:38:56Z,"From gene regulatory networks to mutualistic networks, controlling a single node in the network topology can transform these complex dynamical systems from undesirable states to desirable ones. Corresponding methods have been well-studied in one-dimensional dynamical systems. However, many practical dynamical systems require description by multi-dimensional dynamical systems, such as the mutualistic symbiotic systems formed by flowering plants and pollinating insects. Existing one-dimensional methods cannot handle the cases of multi-dimensional dynamical systems. Based on this, we propose a method to control a single node to activate network connections in multi-dimensional dynamical systems. In such systems, the changes of each node are described by multiple nonlinear differential equations. All remaining nodes are stratified according to the shortest path to the controlled node, thereby reducing the dimensionality of the system. Such a large-scale dynamical system can ultimately be replaced by a very simple system. By analyzing the reduced-dimensional system, we can predict the extent of control needed to restore the system state. We apply this method to a wide range of fields, achieving activation of various real multidimensional complex dynamical systems.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15837v1

We then show that 'chaotic' dynamical systems (more precisely, Axiom A systems) and 'integrable' dynamical systems (more generally, measure-preserving systems) cannot robustly simulate universal Turing machines, although such machines can be robustly simulated by other kinds of dynamical systems. Subsequently, we show that any Turing machine that can be encoded into a structurally stable one-dimensional dynamical system must have a decidable halting problem, and moreover an explicit time complexity bound in instances where it does halt. More broadly, our work elucidates what it means for one 'machine' to simulate another, and emphasizes the necessity of defining low-complexity 'encoders' and 'decoders' to translate between the dynamics of the simulation and the system being simulated.

Seth",2021-06-11T17:11:45Z,"We introduce a notion of emergence for coarse-grained macroscopic variables associated with highly-multivariate microscopic dynamical processes, in the context of a coupled dynamical environment. Dynamical independence instantiates the intuition of an emergent macroscopic process as one possessing the characteristics of a dynamical system ""in its own right"", with its own dynamical laws distinct from those of the underlying microscopic dynamics. We quantify (departure from) dynamical independence by a transformation-invariant Shannon information-based measure of dynamical dependence. We emphasise the data-driven discovery of dynamically-independent macroscopic variables, and introduce the idea of a multiscale ""emergence portrait"" for complex systems. We show how dynamical dependence may be computed explicitly for linear systems via state-space modelling, in both time and frequency domains, facilitating discovery of emergent phenomena at all spatiotemporal scales. We discuss application of the state-space operationalisation to inference of the emergence portrait for neural systems from neurophysiological time-series data. We also examine dynamical independence for discrete- and continuous-time deterministic dynamics, with potential application to Hamiltonian mechanics and classical complex systems such as flocking and cellular automata.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06511v2
Quiver representations and dimension reduction in dynamical systems,"Eddie Nijholt, Soeren Schwenker, Bob Rink",2020-06-15T01:13:07Z,"Dynamical systems often admit geometric properties that must be taken into account when studying their behaviour. We show that many such properties can be encoded by means of quiver representations. These properties include classical symmetry, hidden symmetry and feedforward structure, as well as subnetwork and quotient relations in network dynamical systems. A quiver equivariant dynamical system consists of a collection of dynamical systems with maps between them that send solutions to solutions. We prove that such quiver structures are preserved under Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction, center manifold reduction, and normal form reduction.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08073v2
Specification in Mahavier Systems via Closed Relations,"Iztok Banič, Goran Erceg, Ivan Jelić, Judy Kennedy",2025-07-01T19:30:41Z,"We study two fundamental properties of topological dynamical systems, the specification property and the initial specification property, and explore their generalizations to the broader setting of CR-dynamical systems, where the dynamics are governed by closed relations rather than continuous functions. While these two properties are equivalent for many classical systems, we demonstrate that their generalizations to CR-dynamical systems often lead to distinct behaviors. Applying them to Mahavier dynamical systems, we introduce new specification-type properties. These generalized notions extend the classical theory and reveal rich structural differences in dynamical behavior. Moreover, each of the new properties reduces to the standard specification property when restricted to continuous functions.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01155v1
The steady states of coupled dynamical systems compose according to   matrix arithmetic,David I. Spivak,2015-12-02T18:34:35Z,"Open dynamical systems are mathematical models of machines that take input, change their internal state, and produce output. For example, one may model anything from neurons to robots in this way. Several open dynamical systems can be arranged in series, in parallel, and with feedback to form a new dynamical system---this is called compositionality---and the process can be repeated in a fractal-like manner to form more complex systems of systems. One issue is that as larger systems are created, their state space grows exponentially.   In this paper a technique for calculating the steady states of an interconnected system of systems, in terms of the steady states of its component dynamical systems, is provided. These are organized into ""steady state matrices"" which generalize bifurcation diagrams. It is shown that the compositionality structure of dynamical systems fits with the familiar monoidal structure for the steady state matrices, where serial, parallel, and feedback composition of matrices correspond to multiplication, Kronecker product, and partial trace operations. The steady state matrices of dynamical systems respect this compositionality structure, exponentially reducing the complexity involved in studying the steady states of composite dynamical systems.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00802v2
Data-driven Identification of Nonlinear Power System Dynamics Using   Output-only Measurements,"Pranav Sharma, Venkataramana Ajjarapu, Umesh Vaidya",2021-10-04T14:13:18Z,"In this paper, we propose a novel approach for the data-driven characterization of power system dynamics. The developed method of Extended Subspace Identification (ESI) is suitable for systems with output measurements when all the dynamics states are not observable. It is particularly applicable for power systems dynamic identification using Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) measurements. As in the case of power systems, it is often expensive or impossible to measure all the internal dynamic states of system components such as generators, controllers and loads. PMU measurements capture voltages, currents, power injection and frequencies, which can be considered as the outputs of system dynamics. The ESI method is suitable for system identification, capturing nonlinear modes, computing participation factor of output measurements in system modes and identifying system parameters such as system inertia. The proposed method is suitable for measurements with a noise similar to realistic system measurements. The developed method addresses some of the known deficiencies of existing data-driven dynamic system characterization methods. The approach is validated for multiple network models and dynamic event scenarios with synthetic PMU measurements.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01469v1

In the latter case the dynamical system is called tame. We use the structure theory of minimal dynamical systems to show that, when the acting group is Abelian, a tame metric minimal dynamical system (i) is almost automorphic (i.e. it is an almost 1-1 extension of an equicontinuous system), and (ii) admits a unique invariant probability measure such that the corresponding measure preserving system is measure theoretically isomorphic to the Haar measure system on the maximal equicontinuous factor.",http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0609503v1

Graph Switching Dynamical Systems,"Yongtuo Liu, Sara Magliacane, Miltiadis Kofinas, Efstratios Gavves",2023-06-01T06:04:45Z,"Dynamical systems with complex behaviours, e.g. immune system cells interacting with a pathogen, are commonly modelled by splitting the behaviour into different regimes, or modes, each with simpler dynamics, and then learning the switching behaviour from one mode to another. Switching Dynamical Systems (SDS) are a powerful tool that automatically discovers these modes and mode-switching behaviour from time series data. While effective, these methods focus on independent objects, where the modes of one object are independent of the modes of the other objects. In this paper, we focus on the more general interacting object setting for switching dynamical systems, where the per-object dynamics also depends on an unknown and dynamically changing subset of other objects and their modes. To this end, we propose a novel graph-based approach for switching dynamical systems, GRAph Switching dynamical Systems (GRASS), in which we use a dynamic graph to characterize interactions between objects and learn both intra-object and inter-object mode-switching behaviour.

Invertible generalized synchronization: A putative mechanism for   implicit learning in biological and artificial neural systems,"Zhixin Lu, Danielle S. Bassett",2018-07-13T00:50:52Z,"Regardless of the marked differences between biological and artificial neural systems, one fundamental similarity is that they are essentially dynamical systems that can learn to imitate other dynamical systems, without knowing their governing equations. The brain is able to learn the dynamic nature of the physical world via experience; analogously, artificial neural systems can learn the long-term behavior of complex dynamical systems from data. Yet, precisely how this implicit learning occurs remains unknown. Here, we draw inspiration from human neuroscience and from reservoir computing to propose a first-principles framework explicating putative mechanisms of implicit learning. Specifically, we show that an arbitrary dynamical system implicitly learns other dynamical attractors by embedding them into its own phase space through invertible generalized synchronization. By sustaining the embedding through fine-tuned feedback loops, the arbitrary dynamical system can imitate the attractor dynamics it has learned. To evaluate the mechanism's relevance, we construct several distinct neural network models that adaptively learn and imitate multiple attractors. We observe and explain the emergence of 5 distinct phenomena reminiscent of cognitive functions: (i) imitating a dynamical system purely from learning the time series, (ii) learning multiple attractors by a single system, (iii) switching among the imitations of multiple attractors, either spontaneously or driven by external cues, (iv) filling-in missing variables from incomplete observations of a learned dynamical system, and (v) deciphering superimposed input from different dynamical systems. Collectively, our findings support the notion that artificial and biological neural networks can learn the dynamic nature of their environment, and systems within their environment, through the mechanism of invertible generalized synchronization.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05214v2

A Closed Form Solution for the Normal Form and Zero Dynamics of a Class   of Nonlinear Systems,Siamak Tafazoli,2018-12-04T20:20:52Z,"The normal form and zero dynamics are powerful tools useful in analysis and control of both linear and nonlinear systems. There are no simple closed form solutions to the general zero dynamics problem for nonlinear systems. A few algorithms exist for determining the zero dynamics, but none is straightforward and all are difficult to apply to large dimensional problems. A Closed form solution to the zero dynamics problem would motivate more usage of this powerful technique. The author presents here a simple algebraic methodology for the normal form and zero dynamics calculation of a class of nonlinear systems, mostly found in dynamical mechanical systems. The solution is in closed form so that application of the theorem presented is straight forward. As an illustration, the zero dynamics calculations for the complex dynamics of a flexible spacecraft is presented to demonstrate the simplicity and usefulness of the proposed closed form solution.

Generalized chronotaxic systems: time-dependent oscillatory dynamics   stable under continuous perturbation,"Yevhen F. Suprunenko, Aneta Stefanovska",2014-07-20T11:54:24Z,"Chronotaxic systems represent deterministic nonautonomous oscillatory systems which are capable of resisting continuous external perturbations while having a complex time-dependent dynamics. Until their recent introduction in \emph{Phys. Rev. Lett.} \textbf{111}, 024101 (2013) chronotaxic systems had often been treated as stochastic, inappropriately, and the deterministic component had been ignored. While the previous work addressed the case of the decoupled amplitude and phase dynamics, in this paper we develop a generalized theory of chronotaxic systems where such decoupling is not required. The theory presented is based on the concept of a time-dependent point attractor or a driven steady state and on the contraction theory of dynamical systems. This simplifies the analysis of chronotaxic systems and makes possible the identification of chronotaxic systems with time-varying parameters. All types of chronotaxic dynamics are classified and their properties are discussed using the nonautonomous Poincar\'e oscillator as an example. We demonstrate that these types differ in their transient dynamics towards a driven steady state and according to their response to external perturbations. Various possible realizations of chronotaxic systems are discussed, including systems with temporal chronotaxicity and interacting chronotaxic systems.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.5277v1
Compositionality of the Runge-Kutta Method,Timothy Ngotiaoco,2017-07-10T11:33:39Z,"In Spivak's work, dynamical systems are described in terms of their inputs and outputs in a pictorial way using an operad of wiring diagrams. Each dynamical system is a box with certain inputs and outputs, and multiple dynamical systems are linked together using wiring diagrams, which describe how the outputs of one dynamical system to the inputs of another. By describing dynamical systems in this way, we can decompose a large dynamical system as a collection of smaller, simpler dynamical systems linked together. Of course, this decomposition is only useful if we can work with these smaller, simpler dynamical systems instead of the larger one. In his paper, Spivak shows that we can perform Euler's method on these smaller systems and still get the same results as working on the larger one. In this paper, we extend his results to prove that we can do something similar with the Runge-Kutta method. However, we need to modify the framework used in Spivak's paper to account for the fact that the Runge-Kutta method requires multiple steps, unlike Euler's method. To better describe these systems, we define wiring diagrams as objects of a double-category and dynamical systems in terms of double functors, giving a categorical description of this approximation method.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.02804v1
Alterations And Rearrangements Of A Non-Autonomous Dynamical System,"Puneet Sharma, Manish Raghav",2017-11-23T04:47:39Z,"In this paper, we discuss the dynamics of alterations and rearrangements of a non-autonomous dynamical system generated by the family $\mathbb{F}$. We prove that while insertion/deletion of a map in the family $\mathbb{F}$ can disturb the dynamics of a system, the dynamics of the system does not change if the map inserted/deleted is feeble open. In the process, we prove that if the inserted/deleted map is feeble open, the altered system exhibits any form of mixing/sensitivity if and only if the original system exhibits the same. We extend our investigations to properties like equicontinuity, minimality and proximality for the two systems. We prove that any finite rearrangement of a non-autonomous dynamical system preserves the dynamics of original system if the family $\mathbb{F}$ is feeble open. We also give examples to show that the dynamical behavior of a system need be not be preserved under infinite rearrangement.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.08573v2
"Visual Analysis of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems: Chaos, Fractals,   Self-Similarity and the Limits of Prediction",Geoff Boeing,2016-08-15T21:36:26Z,"Nearly all nontrivial real-world systems are nonlinear dynamical systems. Chaos describes certain nonlinear dynamical systems that have a very sensitive dependence on initial conditions. Chaotic systems are always deterministic and may be very simple, yet they produce completely unpredictable and divergent behavior. Systems of nonlinear equations are difficult to solve analytically, and scientists have relied heavily on visual and qualitative approaches to discover and analyze the dynamics of nonlinearity. Indeed, few fields have drawn as heavily from visualization methods for their seminal innovations: from strange attractors, to bifurcation diagrams, to cobweb plots, to phase diagrams and embedding. Although the social sciences are increasingly studying these types of systems, seminal concepts remain murky or loosely adopted. This article has three aims. First, it argues for several visualization methods to critically analyze and understand the behavior of nonlinear dynamical systems. Second, it uses these visualizations to introduce the foundations of nonlinear dynamics, chaos, fractals, self-similarity and the limits of prediction. Finally, it presents Pynamical, an open-source Python package to easily visualize and explore nonlinear dynamical systems' behavior.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04416v2
Learning Dissipative Neural Dynamical Systems,"Yuezhu Xu, S. Sivaranjani",2023-09-27T21:25:26Z,"Consider an unknown nonlinear dynamical system that is known to be dissipative. The objective of this paper is to learn a neural dynamical model that approximates this system, while preserving the dissipativity property in the model. In general, imposing dissipativity constraints during neural network training is a hard problem for which no known techniques exist. In this work, we address the problem of learning a dissipative neural dynamical system model in two stages. First, we learn an unconstrained neural dynamical model that closely approximates the system dynamics. Next, we derive sufficient conditions to perturb the weights of the neural dynamical model to ensure dissipativity, followed by perturbation of the biases to retain the fit of the model to the trajectories of the nonlinear system. We show that these two perturbation problems can be solved independently to obtain a neural dynamical model that is guaranteed to be dissipative while closely approximating the nonlinear system.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16032v2
Dimensional reduction of dynamical systems on graphons,"Bisna Mary Eldo, Sarbendu Rakshit, Naoki Masuda",2025-03-21T16:09:06Z,"Dynamical systems on networks are inherently high-dimensional unless the number of nodes is extremely small. Dimension reduction methods for dynamical systems on networks aim to find a substantially lower-dimensional system that preserves key properties of the original dynamics such as bifurcation structure. A class of such methods proposed in network science research entails finding a one- (or low-) dimensional system that a particular weighted average of the state variables of all nodes in the network approximately obeys. We formulate and mathematically analyze this dimension reduction technique for dynamical systems on dense graphons, or the limiting, infinite-dimensional object of a sequence of graphs with an increasing number of nodes. We first theoretically justify the continuum limit for a nonlinear dynamical system of our interest, and the existence and uniqueness of the solution of graphon dynamical systems. We then derive the reduced one-dimensional system on graphons and prove its convergence properties. Finally, we perform numerical simulations for various graphons and dynamical system models to assess the accuracy of the one-dimensional approximation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17268v1

A Lower Bound on the Dimension of the $\mathbb{R}$-Disguised Toric Locus   of a Reaction Network,"Gheorghe Craciun, Abhishek Deshpande, Jiaxin Jin",2023-04-29T16:48:17Z,"Polynomial dynamical systems (i.e. dynamical systems with polynomial right hand side) are ubiquitous in applications, especially as models of reaction networks and interaction networks. The properties of general polynomial dynamical systems can be very difficult to analyze, due to nonlinearity, bifurcations, and the possibility for chaotic dynamics. On the other hand, toric dynamical systems are polynomial dynamical systems that appear naturally as models of reaction networks, and have very robust and stable properties. A disguised toric dynamical system is a polynomial dynamical system generated by a reaction network $\mathcal N$ and some choice of positive parameters, such that (even though it may not be toric with respect to $\mathcal N$) it has a toric realization with respect to some network $\mathcal N'$. Disguised toric dynamical systems enjoy all the robust stability properties of toric dynamical systems. In this paper, we study a larger set of dynamical systems where the rate constants are allowed to take both positive and negative values. More precisely, we analyze the $\mathbb{R}$-disguised toric locus of a reaction network $\mathcal N$, i.e., the subset in the space rate constants (positive or negative) of $\mathcal N$ for which the corresponding polynomial dynamical system is disguised toric. We focus especially on finding a lower bound on the dimension of the $\mathbb{R}$-disguised toric locus.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00299v2
Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Mesoscopic Chaotic Systems,"Raymond Kapral, Xiao-Guang Wu",1996-02-06T23:12:59Z,An investigation of the mesoscopic dynamics of chemical systems whose mass action equation gives rise to a deterministic chaotic attractor is carried out. A reactive lattice-gas model for the three-variable autocatalator is used to provide a mesoscopic description of the dynamics. The global and local dynamics is studied as a function of system size and diffusion coefficient. When the diffusion length is comparable to the system size phase coherence is maintained but the amplitudes of the oscillations are uncorrelated due to interaction between fluctuations and the instability of the chaotic dynamics. If the diffusion length is small compared to the system size then phase turbulence serves to destroy the noisy global attractor.,http://arxiv.org/abs/chao-dyn/9602008v1

We introduce the concept of dynamical consistency for Koopman representations and analyze several existing and proposed representations deriving necessary constraints on the dynamical system, observables, and Koopman operators. Our main result is a hybrid formulation which independently and jointly observes the state and control inputs. This formulation admits a relatively large space of dynamical systems compared to earlier formulations while keeping the Koopman operator independent of the state and control inputs.

Reachability of Nonlinear Systems with Unknown Dynamics,"Taha Shafa, Melkior Ornik",2021-08-25T04:50:31Z,"Determining the reachable set for a given nonlinear control system is crucial for system control and planning. However, computing such a set is impossible if the system's dynamics are not fully known. This paper is motivated by a scenario where a system suffers an adverse event mid-operation, resulting in a substantial change to the system's dynamics, rendering them largely unknown. Our objective is to conservatively approximate the system's reachable set solely from its local dynamics at a single point and the bounds on the rate of change of its dynamics. We translate this knowledge about the system dynamics into an ordinary differential inclusion. We then derive a conservative approximation of the velocities available to the system at every system state.

The Bootstrap for Dynamical Systems,"Kasun Fernando, Nan Zou",2021-08-19T03:06:36Z,"Despite their deterministic nature, dynamical systems often exhibit seemingly random behaviour. Consequently, a dynamical system is usually represented by a probabilistic model of which the unknown parameters must be estimated using statistical methods. When measuring the uncertainty of such parameter estimation, the bootstrap stands out as a simple but powerful technique. In this paper, we develop the bootstrap for dynamical systems and establish not only its consistency but also its second-order efficiency via a novel \textit{continuous} Edgeworth expansion for dynamical systems. This is the first time such continuous Edgeworth expansions have been studied. Moreover, we verify the theoretical results about the bootstrap using computer simulations.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08461v1
"Ergodicity properties of $p$ -adic $(2,1)$-rational dynamical systems   with unique fixed point",Iskandar A. Sattarov,2018-03-06T08:30:50Z,"We consider a family of $(2,1)$-rational functions given on the set of $p$-adic field $Q_p$. Each such function has a unique fixed point. We study ergodicity properties of the dynamical systems generated by $(2,1)$-rational functions. For each such function we describe all possible invariant spheres. We characterize ergodicity of each $p$-adic dynamical system with respect to Haar measure reduced on each invariant sphere. In particular, we found an invariant spheres on which the dynamical system is ergodic and on all other invariant spheres the dynamical systems are not ergodic.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02059v1
A spectral approach to quenched linear and higher-order response for   partially hyperbolic dynamics,"Harry Crimmins, Yushi Nakano",2021-05-24T10:28:57Z,"For smooth random dynamical systems we consider the quenched linear and higher-order response of equivariant physical measures to perturbations of the random dynamics. We show that the spectral perturbation theory of Gou\""ezel, Keller, and Liverani, which has been applied to deterministic systems with great success, may be adapted to study random systems that possess good mixing properties. As a consequence, we obtain general linear and higher-order response results for random dynamical systems that we then apply to random Anosov diffeomorphisms and random U(1) extensions of expanding maps. We emphasise that our results apply to random dynamical systems over a general ergodic base map, and are obtained without resorting to infinite dimensional multiplicative ergodic theory.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11188v1

Data-driven Influence Based Clustering of Dynamical Systems,Subhrajit Sinha,2022-04-05T17:26:47Z,"Community detection is a challenging and relevant problem in various disciplines of science and engineering like power systems, gene-regulatory networks, social networks, financial networks, astronomy etc. Furthermore, in many of these applications the underlying system is dynamical in nature and because of the complexity of the systems involved, deriving a mathematical model which can be used for clustering and community detection, is often impossible. Moreover, while clustering dynamical systems, it is imperative that the dynamical nature of the underlying system is taken into account. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for clustering dynamical systems purely from time-series data which inherently takes into account the dynamical evolution of the underlying system. In particular, we define a \emph{distance/similarity} measure between the states of the system which is a function of the influence that the states have on each other, and use the proposed measure for clustering of the dynamical system. For data-driven computation we leverage the Koopman operator framework which takes into account the nonlinearities (if present) of the underlying system, thus making the proposed framework applicable to a wide range of application areas. We illustrate the efficacy of the proposed approach by clustering three different dynamical systems, namely, a linear system, which acts like a proof of concept, the highly non-linear IEEE 39 bus transmission network and dynamic variables obtained from atmospheric data over the Amazon rain forest.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02373v1

Yi",2015-10-05T06:19:17Z,"The dynamical invariant, whose expectation value is constant, is generalized to open quantum system. The evolution equation of dynamical invariant (the dynamical invariant condition) is presented for Markovian dynamics. Different with the dynamical invariant for the closed quantum system, the evolution of the dynamical invariant for the open quantum system is no longer unitary, and the eigenvalues of it are time-dependent. Since any hermitian operator fulfilling dynamical invariant condition is a dynamical invariant, we propose a sort of special dynamical invariant (decoherence free dynamical invariant) in which a part of eigenvalues are still constant. The dynamical invariant in the subspace spanned by the corresponding eigenstates evolves unitarily. Via the dynamical invariant condition, the results demonstrate that this dynamical invariant exists under the circumstances of emergence of decoherence free subspaces.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.01038v2

Our story will necessarily involve chaos, but not in the terms secure chaotic communications have introduced it: we will look for the chaos, complexity and dynamics that already exist in everyday wireless communications. We present a short overview of dynamical systems and chaos before focusing on the applications of dynamical systems theory to wireless communications in the past 30 years, ranging from the modeling on the physical layer to different kinds of self-similar traffic encountered all the way up to the network layer. The examples of past research and its implications are grouped and mapped onto the media layers of ISO OSI model to show just how ubiquitous dynamical systems theory can be and to trace the paths that may be taken now. When considering the future paths, we argue that the time has come for us to revive the interest in dynamical systems for wireless communications. It did not happen already because of the big question: can we afford observing systems of our interest as dynamical systems and what are the trade-offs? The answers to these questions are dynamical systems of its own: they change not only with the modeling context, but also with time.
