BUILT TO FAIL: THE INHERENT FRAGILITY OF
ALGORITHMIC STABLECOINS

Dr. Ryan Clements*

Algorithmic  stablecoins  are  inherently  fragile.    These
uncollateralized digital assets, which attempt to peg the price
of a reference asset using financial engineering, algorithms,
and market incentives, are not stable at all but exist in a state
of perpetual vulnerability.  Iterations to date have struggled
to  maintain  a  stable  peg,  and  some  have
failed
catastrophically.    This  Article  argues  that  algorithmic
stablecoins  are  fundamentally  flawed  because  they  rely  on
three  factors  which  history  has  shown  to  be  impossible  to
control.    First,  they  require  a  support  level  of  demand  for
operational stability.  Second, they rely on independent actors
with market incentives to perform price-stabilizing arbitrage.
Finally, they require reliable price information at all times.
None of these factors are certain, and all of them have proven
to be historically tenuous in the context of financial crises or
periods  of  extreme  volatility.    Regulatory  guidelines  are
needed for all stablecoin forms, including issuer registration
requirements,  a  defined
forms,
prudential, collateral custody, and transparency safeguards,
and  risk  disclosure  and  containment  measures.    A  strong
regulatory framework, with risk disclosure and containment
safeguards,
for  algorithmic
stablecoins,  which  currently  serve  only  speculative  DeFi
trading  applications  and  have  very  little,  if  any,  societal  or
financial inclusionary value.

INTRODUCTION

Financial  product  innovation  is  not  always  a  good  thing,  and
certain innovations are designed in a way to make them inherently
unstable.  In 2008, the entire financial system nearly collapsed due to
a  dizzying  array  of  complex  securitization-driven,  derivatives-
enhanced financial product innovations, which emanated from home

loans.1  Now,  a  new,  increasingly  popular,2  poorly-designed3  and
inherently fragile4 financial product has recently emerged, that needs
to be appropriately regulated—the algorithmic stablecoin.

An  algorithmic  stablecoin  is  a  contradiction  of  terms.5    The
market iterations of the algorithmic stablecoin to date have revealed
a total lack of stability.6  It is an unregulated, uncollateralized digital
asset that operates in a perpetually vulnerable state.7  An algorithmic
stablecoin has no true peg,8 but rather derives value solely from what
the crypto-asset task force of the European Central Bank calls, “the
expectation  of  its  future  market  value.”9    As  a  result,  it  is  an
incredibly tenuous payment mechanism.  Algorithmic stablecoins are
heralded by some as a more “capital efficient”10 antidote to the wild
daily  price  volatility  of  popular  cryptocurrencies  like  Bitcoin  and

Ether,11  which  limits  their  functionality  as  a  money  substitute  for
consumer transactions, wages, or deferred debt payments.12  Others
have claimed that algorithmic stablecoins are “recreating traditional
banking”  as  a  decentralized  finance  (“DeFi”)  fractional  reserve
system.13    Both  comparisons  miss  the  mark,  and  the  proclaimed
utility of algorithmic stablecoins is vastly overstated and misleading
because  of  three  lessons  from  history  that  make  them  inherently
fragile.

First, algorithmic stablecoins require a support level of demand
for  the  entire  ecosystem  to  operate.14    If  demand  falls  below  a
threshold level, the entire system will fail.15  History shows that base
or  floor  levels  of  support  for  financial  products  is  not  guaranteed—
especially  in  a  crisis.16    Second,  algorithmic  stablecoins  rely  on
independent  actors  with  market  incentives  to  perform  price-
stabilizing  arbitrage  to  maintain  a  so-called  “stable”  ecosystem.17
History  again  reveals  that  reliance  on  independent,  market-driven
actors,  without
legal  obligations,  to  perform  price-stabilizing
discretionary arbitrage is also fragile.18  Finally, history has proven
that  in  a  crisis,  information  becomes  opaque,  noise  crowds  signal,
prices and counterparties become uncertain, and cascades and herds
easily  form.19
  Informational  opacity  undermines  the  token
“economics” and incentive structures of algorithmic stablecoins.20

If  the  “tokenomic”  incentive  structure  in  any  algorithmic
stablecoin ecosystem breaks down, the entire ecosystem fails without

structures  have  been  so  slow  to  materialize.    The  International
Organization  of  Securities  Commissions  (“IOSCO”)  has  suggested
that stablecoins come in many different varieties and forms.28

The most popular form is an “off-chain” custodial stablecoin, like
Circle  and  Coinbase’s  widely  circulated  USD  Coin  (“USDC”),29  or
Facebook’s  proposed  Diem,30  both  of  which  use  “holdings  of  fiat
currency  or  high-quality  liquid  assets  as  a  reserve.”31    Or  Tether,
which  claims  to  be  collateralized  with  vast  holdings  of  commercial
paper.32    Other  stablecoins  are  either  fully  collateralized,  or  “over-
collateralized.”33    Over-collateralized  means  that  more  than  100
percent of the value of the stablecoin is held “on-chain,” using another
crypto-asset  to  serve  the  collateral  function—like  MakerDAO’s
ERC20  Dai  (“DAI”)  token.34    Using  another  crypto-asset  in  this
manner, DAI collateralizes a variety of crypto-assets, with collateral
ratios adjusted for the particular locked-up token.35

The  most  unstable  and  fragile  variety  of  stablecoins  are
“algorithmic,”  which  are  not  fully  collateralized  and  use  market
incentives, arbitrage opportunities, automated smart contracts, and
reserve  token  adjustments  to  attempt  to  maintain  a  stable  peg.36
These  kinds  of  stablecoins  have  been  described  as  an  algorithmic
“Central Bank.”37  The size of the stablecoin market has skyrocketed
to  over  $119  billion  in  2021,38  and  algorithmic  varieties  are  a
significant and growing portion of this market.39

WAKE FOREST LAW REVIEW

[Vol. 11

Despite  the  spectacular  failure  of  Iron  Finance  in  June  2021,40
algorithmic  stablecoins  have  the  purported  benefit  of  automated
operation  and  the  ability  to  scale  without  requiring  corresponding
reserves.41  In basic terms, the protocol underpinning an algorithmic
stablecoin attempts to operate as a central bank, with “less than one-
to-one  backing”42  by  manipulating  the  number  of  tokens  in
“circulation” in response to changes in their value.43

There are a variety of algorithmic stablecoin models, as well as
contentions  on  their  exact  definition.44    They  generally  look  to
combine  monetary  supply  with  embedded  economic  incentives  to
artificially  control  the  price  of  the  stablecoin.45    For  example,  if  a
stablecoin  was  trading  below  $1,  an  algorithmic  system  may  offer
some  other  type  of  digital  asset,  digital  “bond,”  “coupon,”  or  issued
“share” for less than $1, with the new capital used to maintain the

42.  See Morris, supra note 13.
43.  See Whelan, supra note 12.
44.  For a fuller explanation of this process, see Shevchenko, supra note 4,

who explains:

While these tokens are commonly considered algorithmic stablecoins,
the  teams  involved  have  their  own  definitions.    For  MakerDAO,  an
algorithmic  stablecoin  is  one  that  uses  total  supply  manipulations  to
maintain  a  peg.    The  founders  of  Empty  Set  Dollar  and  Neutrino,  a
Waves-backed  stablecoin  project,  believe  Dai  is  also  an  algorithmic
stablecoin  due  to
its  programmatic  mint-and-burn  mechanics.
Ampleforth’s team, on the other hand, rejects the notion that its token
is a stablecoin.

In addition to the “two-coin” model described in the body of the Article, there is
also a less popular “rebase model” which has shown difficulty retaining its peg
due  to  volatility  and  market  fluctuations.    For  a  discussion  of  this  alternate
model, see Liu, supra note 4, who explains:

[B]y adjusting token balances in user wallets, rebase stablecoins ensure
that  holders  always  retain  the  same  percentage  share  of  the  entire
market capitalization.  Ampleforth (AMPL) is a good example of such a
stablecoin,  especially  since  there  are  no  other  notable  projects  using
this  model.    YAM  Finance,  a  DeFi  project  that  was  once  extremely
popular, also recently disabled its rebase feature.

Id.; see also Shevchenko, supra note 4 (providing an additional description of the
rebase model).

peg.46    A  common  algorithmic  stablecoin  structure  is  a  “two-coin”
system, where one coin is used to maintain the peg, and the other is
used  to  “absorb”  market  volatility.47    This  latter  token  is  usually
called a “share” or “balancer” token,48 and often trades on secondary
DeFi  exchanges  like  Uniswap.49    Two-coin  systems  are  often
combined  with  partial  collateralization  dynamics,50  such  as  those
described  in  the  next  Part  with  Iron  Finance’s  IRON  algorithmic
stablecoin.

II.  THE IRON FINANCE FAILURE IS A BIG RED FLAG FOR THE
PRODUCT CLASS

Iron  Finance  describes  itself  exotically  as  a  “multi-chain,
decentralized,  non-custodial  ecosystem  of  DeFi  products,  protocols,
and  use  cases.”51    Their  original  system  was  a  two-coin  structure
which attempted to create an algorithmic stablecoin called “IRON.”52
IRON was pegged to $1, without having the actual backing of $1.53  A
reboot—“v2”—was recently announced for an “over-collateralized and
soft-pegged” stablecoin.54  Prior to its nearly $2 billion failure, each
IRON  stablecoin  was  “minted”  through  a  process  that  locked  75
percent  of  its  value  in  collateralized  USDC  (a  fully  reserved,  fiat-
backed  stablecoin55),  and  25  percent  of  its  value  through  locked-in
“TITAN”—Iron Finance’s own, unlimited supply, internal governance
token.56

TITAN  was  backed  by  nothing,  and  its  value  was  solely
determined  in  the  secondary  DeFi  market.57    The  original  protocol
relied on a market-driven “arbitrage” opportunity between the IRON

46.  Id. (“Essentially, speculators are offered a small portion of future growth
in the stablecoin’s market cap in exchange for providing the capital to peg the
currency.”); see Koning, supra note 4 (“A coupon, in short, can be thought of as a
promise to pay even more ESD stablecoins in the future, conditional on locking
up one’s ESD stablecoins now, but only if and when the $1 peg has been restored.
The further that the price of ESD stablecoins falls below $1, the more enticing
the system-set conversion rate into coupons gets.”).

stablecoin and the TITAN governance token.58  If IRON lost its peg
and  traded  below  $1,  an  arbitrageur  could  purchase  it  on  the
secondary  market  and  redeem  it  for  $1  of  combined  USDC  and
TITAN.59  Correspondingly, if IRON traded higher than $1, market
actors could mint new IRON by locking in $1 of combined USDC and
TITAN and then sell the new IRON on the market for a profit.60  The
system also burned the TITAN portion of collateral when IRON was
minted, and minted new TITAN when IRON was redeemed.61  The
system and its assumptions failed, however, in catastrophic fashion.62
Iron Finance unraveled when the value of its unlimited supply
governance  token,  TITAN,  fell  precipitously  in  the  DeFi  secondary
market.63  Iron Finance reported that there was significant selling by
certain “whale” holders.64  The market for TITAN was already thin,65
and this large-value sale triggered a cascade selloff of TITAN and an
IRON redemption “negative feedback loop.”66  This caused the IRON
token  to  lose  its  peg,  which  in  turn  “triggered”  the  algorithmic
minting  mechanism  for  TITAN  and  an  arbitrage  opportunity  in  a
resulting “death spiral.”67

The  net  impact  was  a  flood  of  TITAN  supply  on  the  secondary
market.68  At some point, the price of TITAN was basically zero, and
Iron Finance halted redemptions of the IRON stablecoin—they only
had  75  percent  collateralized  USDC  coverage  to  begin  with.69    The
moment  the  price  of  TITAN  destabilized  in  the  secondary  trading
market, the entire house of cards that was the IRON stablecoin came
down, with nothing to backstop the run.70

The idea has been advanced that algorithmic stablecoins are an
early iteration of DeFi fractional reserve banking.71  Iron Finance—
while interpreting the failure of its so-called stablecoin, IRON—called
it “the world’s first large-scale crypto bank run” in a “post-mortem”
report.72  This analogy is significantly flawed, and the Iron Finance
operating structure was tremendously fragile from inception.

It  sought  to  create  a  dollar  from  seventy-five  cents,  under  the
inaccurate  assumption  that  its  secondary-traded  governance  token,
TITAN, would not fall below a market-determined price floor.  It was
designed on the assumption that TITAN itself would remain stable—
or  even  better,  that  it  would  increase  in  price.    Banks  also  create
money  through  fractional  reserves  and  lending.73  Yet  banks  are
backstopped  by  government  depositary  insurance—and  they  pay
mightily for it in the form of premium payments and being subject to
extensive supervision and examination.74

III.  THREE LESSONS FROM FINANCIAL MARKET HISTORY

Three lessons from financial market history impact the viability
of algorithmic stablecoins.  First, any financial product that needs a
support, or base level, of demand for the product class as a whole to
operate as intended (and assumed) will be prone to failure if demand
dries up.75  Demand is impossible to predict and impacts the price of
all  securities.76    If  a  minimum  level  of  demand  is  necessary  for  a
product to even function, however, this product is inherently fragile.77

As identified in prior work, requiring (but not getting) a support
level of backstopping demand from major financial institutions was a
significant  factor  underpinning  the  failure  of  the  auction  rate
securities market.78  Reliance on a base level of support is perhaps the
biggest problem with an uncollateralized algorithmic stablecoin two-
coin  structure.79    The  volatility  absorbing  coin  must  maintain  a

certain  support  level  of  demand—and  not  fall  below  a  price
threshold—otherwise the entire ecosystem fails.80  Non-collateralized
tokens  that  purport  to  be  “stable”  require  a  consistent,  if  not
increasing, level of demand, and once this stops, the peg fails.81

The  second

lesson  from  history  that  makes  algorithmic
stablecoins inherently fragile and unstable is that they often rely on
independent  actors,  with  market  incentives,  to  perform  a  price
stabilizing  arbitrage  function.82    Arbitrageurs  must  step  in  and
exploit  profit  opportunities  to  maintain  price  stability  through
minting or redemption activities.83  The performance of discretionary,
price-stabilizing  arbitrage  is  historically  fragile  in  a  crisis,  and  as
previously  identified  in  prior  work  on  exchange-traded  funds,
“market discipline can fail when it is most needed.”84

Arbitrageurs  stepped  back  from  buying  up  undervalued  assets
during  the  1987  portfolio  insurance  failure.85    More  recently,
arbitrageurs  stepped  back  from  arbitraging  away  price  dislocations
between  secondary  market  prices  of  fixed-income  exchange  traded
funds (and their underlying net asset values) when the market moved
swiftly to price in March 2020 during the fallout of the coronavirus
pandemic.86

The third lesson from history that casts doubt on the long-term
viability  of  algorithmic  stablecoins  is  that  during  periods  of
heightened  volatility,  panics,  or  crises,  there
is  widespread
informational opacity.87  Effectively incorporating price information
is  a  problem  that  “plagues”  many  algorithmic  stablecoins.88    Price
“oracles”  (external  price  feeds)  cannot  always  be  trusted,  and  there
are  “misaligned”  incentive  problems  when  token  holders  vote  on
which  potential  price  feeds  (from  a  pool  of  them)  to  adopt.89    Price
uncertainty in the TITAN token, as a result of delays in an automated

failure.90

When  information  is  uncertain,  cascades  and  investor  herds
form, and perceived unsafe assets are quickly sold off in fire sales—a
phenomenon  evident  in  the  2008  global  financial  crisis,  even  for
certain  financial  assets  like  commercial  paper  and  money  market
mutual  funds  that  were  perceived  as  stable  before  the  crisis.91
Informational opacity also affects the ability of market participants
to perform price-stabilizing arbitrage, as was the case with the failure
of portfolio insurance in 1987.92

IV.  STABLECOINS AS STANDING DOMINOS IN BUDDING ALGORITHMIC
ECOSYSTEMS

Perhaps the most popular algorithmic stablecoin platform right
now is Terra.93  The creator of Terra, Terraform Labs, has received
significant recent venture capital backing and investor interest as a
“stablecoin for e-commerce creator.”94  Terra mints U.S. dollar- and
Korean won-pegged algorithmic stablecoins (among others), using a
governance  balancing  token  (known  as  LUNA),  with  built-in
monetary  supply  and  economic  incentives  including  fees  and
arbitrage opportunities.95

90.  See  Jakub,  supra  note  58  (“Because  of  the  extremely  quick  and  sharp
drop in the TITAN price, the time-weighted price oracle used for reporting TITAN
prices started reporting stale prices that were still higher than the actual market
price of TITAN.  This created a negative feedback loop as the price oracle was
used  to  determine  the  number  of  TITAN  tokens  that  have  to  be  printed  while
redeeming IRON.”).

burgeoning
the
“infrastructure”
aforementioned  e-commerce  payments,  synthetic  stocks,  exchange-
traded  funds,  derivatives,  and  other  financial  assets,  savings,
borrowing, and lending applications.100  The operation of Terra, as a
protocol, incentivizes independent traders to purchase its stablecoins
in  exchange  for  LUNA  if  a  stablecoin  drops  below  its  peg.101    The
stability  of  Terra  stablecoins  transcends  DeFi  speculation.    Given
their many applications within its “Terra economy,” these algorithmic
stablecoins also directly impacts the economic prospects of a host of
businesses and consumers.102

In order for this ecosystem to be continually viable, there must
be a perpetual baseline level of demand in the Terra stablecoins and
also the governance token, LUNA.103  In other words, there must be
sufficient  arbitrage  activity  between  the  two  tokens,104  as  well  as
sufficient  transactional  fees  in  the  Terra  ecosystem  and  mining
demand in the network.105  The founders of Terra have asserted that
mainstream adoption of their stablecoins as transactional currencies,

the LUNA token as a price stabilizing measure for the terra stablecoins whenever
it  loses  its  peg.    See  Hor,  supra  note  93  (“This  system  offers  arbitrage
opportunities whenever a Terra stablecoin is trading off the peg; arbitrageurs are
thus  incentivized  to  ensure  the  price  returns  to  its  peg.    LUNA’s  burning
mechanism  further  complements  this—a  portion  of  LUNA  is  burned  during
expansion  and  algorithmically  adjusted  until  UST  is  restored  to  $1.    In  other
words,  the  price  volatility  of  Terra  stablecoins  are  effectively  transferred  onto
LUNA’s fluctuating supply.”); see Walters, supra note 12.

and the ability to “stake” them and earn rewards, creates “network
effects”  and  long-term  incentives  to  hold  and  maintain  the
ecosystem.106

Thus,  Terra  is  betting  that  use  on  their  “network”  of  financial
applications  that  utilize  the  stablecoins  (and  LUNA)  will  drive
perpetual  demand.107    This  assumption  is  not  certain,108  and  Terra
stablecoins  have  deviated  from  their  peg  in  the  past.109    In  many
ways,  a  developing  DeFi  financial  ecosystem  that  is  backed  by  an
algorithmic  stablecoin  with  no  real  collateral  or  government
guarantee, but instead relying on perpetual interest of individually
motivated  market  actors  for  sustainability,  looks  like  standing
dominos—once the first falls, all of the others could be affected.

CONCLUSION

Despite  the  “quest”  for  a  conceptual  model  of  sustainable  price
stability,110  algorithmic  stablecoins  have  shown  an  utter  lack  of
stability  to  date,  and  are  thus  unsuitable  as  a  money  substitute.111
Unlike  their  collateralized  cousins,  algorithmic  stablecoin  varieties
seem “destined to fail.”112  Financial writer J.P. Koning has argued
that they are “prone to permanent breakage” because of their fragile
reliance on a “circular relationship” between divergent actors—those
who  crave  “stability”  on  the  one  hand  and  those  who  alternatively
seek  “high-return  opportunities.”113    Algorithmic  stablecoins  are
unlikely to serve any true long-term, consumer welfare-enhancing, or

speculation,114  which  yields  very  little  inclusionary  or  system-wide
benefits.    As  others  have  noted,  their  “instability  threatens  their
usefulness.”115

openly admitted that they are “unstable” and prone to volatility.  See Shevchenko,

advisor to Ampleforth and co-author of its whitepaper, fully accepted the fact that
Ampleforth  is  unstable:  ‘Ampleforth  holders  can  experience  gains  and  losses
much  in  the  same  way  that  Bitcoin  or  Ethereum  holders  can.  Thus,  it  is  a

periods of extreme volatility.117  History reveals they are likely prone

There  is  a  need  for  an  integrated  approach  to  regulating
stablecoins  that  transcends  agency  divides.    Ideally,  a  regulatory
framework  for  all  stablecoins  will  include  issuer  registration
requirements,  prudential  measures,  collateral  custodial  safeguards,
and reporting transparency, a defined taxonomy clarifying stablecoin
forms (and distinguishing algorithmic varieties from other types), and
risk disclosure and containment measures.126

Such a framework may require what newly appointed SEC Chair
Gary  Gensler  has  described  as  “plenary  authority”  for  a  particular
agency  over  crypto-trading,127  albeit,  adapted  and  applied  for
stablecoins.  Some fully collateralized stablecoins may have financial
inclusionary  benefits  such  as  faster  and  cheaper  global  remittance,
real-time  payments,  application  in  fiscal  stimulus  efforts,  and  the
ability  to  serve  as  a  transaction  proxy  for  thin  credit  files  and  the
underbanked.128
innovation-supportive  regulatory
framework, which still creates transparency, risk containment, and
consumer protection safeguards, is warranted.129
