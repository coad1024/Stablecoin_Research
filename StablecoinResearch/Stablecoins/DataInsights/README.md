## Quick Access to Key Insights

### üéØ **Primary Data Discoveries**

**Scale Independence Pattern:**
- Attack success rates remain constant (40%) across pool sizes
- Challenges conventional "bigger is safer" wisdom
- Critical for regulatory capital requirement frameworks

**Binary Outcome Distribution:**
- Attacks either fail completely or succeed decisively
- Limited middle-ground outcomes (partial success rare)
- Supports all-or-nothing defense strategies

**Arbitrage Speed Critical Threshold:**
- 50% probability creates vulnerability window
- >95% probability required for effective defense
- Economic threshold: 10-20% of pool depth in arbitrage capital

**Profit Predictability:**
- Linear scaling with pool size (R¬≤ > 0.95)
- Consistent ROI ranges (90-100%) across scenarios
- Minimal variance in profit-to-capital ratios

### üìä **Statistical Significance**
