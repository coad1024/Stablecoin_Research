## Hypothesis Testing

### **H1: Pool Size Independence**

**Null Hypothesis:** Attack success rate varies significantly with pool size
**Alternative:** Success rate independent of pool size (for percentage-based attacks)

**Test Results:**
```
ANOVA F-statistic: 1.43
p-value: 0.238
Conclusion: Fail to reject null at α=0.05
Evidence: Pool size has no significant effect on success rate
```

**Effect Size Analysis:**
```
Eta-squared: 0.031 (small effect)
Cohen's d: 0.18 (negligible practical difference)
Interpretation: Pool size explains <5% of variance in success rate
```

### **H2: User Regime Impact**

**Null Hypothesis:** User behavior regime has no effect on attack success
**Alternative:** Panic regime significantly increases attack success

**Test Results:**
```
Two-sample t-test:
Normal Regime Mean: 28.4%
Panic Regime Mean: 45.8%
t-statistic: 8.67
p-value: < 0.001
Cohen's d: 1.54 (large effect)
```

**Conclusion:** Strong evidence that panic conditions significantly increase attack vulnerability

### **H3: Arbitrage Speed Effect**

**Null Hypothesis:** Arbitrage response speed has no effect on success rate
**Alternative:** Faster arbitrage significantly reduces attack success

**Test Results:**
```
Linear Regression: Success_Rate = 0.73 - 0.65 × Arbitrage_Probability
R-squared: 0.891
Slope p-value: < 0.001
95% CI for slope: [-0.71, -0.59]
```

**Interpretation:** Each 0.1 increase in arbitrage probability reduces success rate by ~6.5%
