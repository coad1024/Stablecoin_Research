- Precision: 89.7% (attack detection)
- Recall: 84.2% (attack prevention)

```

### **Local Model Interpretability**

**LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations):**
```
Example High-Risk Scenario:
Attack_Percentage = 7.2%, Arbitrage_Prob = 0.4, Panic_Regime

Feature Contributions:
+ Attack_Percentage (7.2%): +0.31 (towards attack success)
+ Market_Regime (Panic): +0.18 (towards attack success)
- Arbitrage_Probability (0.4): -0.07 (towards attack success)
+ Pool_Depth (low): +0.05 (towards attack success)

Final Prediction: 78% attack success probability
Confidence Interval: [71%, 84%]
```

**Individual Prediction Explanations:**
```
Prediction: 85% attack success
Confidence: High (model agreement: 94%)

Top Contributing Factors:
1. Large attack size (8.1%) → +42% probability
2. Panic market conditions → +28% probability  
3. Weak arbitrage response (P=0.3) → +18% probability
4. Weekend timing → +7% probability

Risk Mitigation Suggestions:
1. Improve arbitrage response to P>0.7 → -35% probability
2. Reduce attack incentive through reserves → -15% probability
3. Implement dynamic fees during panic → -12% probability
