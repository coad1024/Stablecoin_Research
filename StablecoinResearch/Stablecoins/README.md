# Stablecoin Research Project

### **Objective**
This project provides a comprehensive analysis, design, and modeling of stablecoin systems. The primary goals are to analyze the architecture of relevant stablecoins, design ideal systems for specific economic environments, and model the economic feasibility of a de-peg attack on an algorithmic stablecoin.

---

### 1. Analysis of Relevant Stablecoins
We will analyze and compare the following three stablecoins based on their core properties:

* **DAI**
* **USDC**
* **Gyroscope (Gyro)**

For each stablecoin, the analysis will focus on:
-   **Backing Mechanism:** How the stablecoin maintains its peg to a target asset.
-   **Sustainability:** The long-term viability and economic soundness of the model.
-   **Decentralization:** The degree of control and censorship resistance within the system.

---

### 2. Design of Ideal Stablecoin Systems
We will propose theoretical designs for ideal stablecoin systems under two distinct economic scenarios:

#### **Environment without Liquidation Risk**
Designing an ideal stablecoin in a hypothetical world where all collateral is guaranteed to not lose its value.

#### **Environment with Highly Risky Collateral**
Designing a stablecoin from scratch where all available collateral assets are highly volatile and prone to liquidation events.

### 3. Modeling of Economic Attack Feasibility
For this section, we have chosen to model the following scenario:
- **De-Peg of an Algorithmic Stablecoin**

Our model will focus on the economic feasibility of this attack. The key objectives are to:
-   Develop a framework to calculate the **cost of executing the attack** versus the **potential profit** for the attacker.
-   Analyze the specific market conditions and protocol vulnerabilities under which such an attack becomes profitable.
-   Propose and evaluate effective mitigation measures to prevent de-pegging or minimize its impact.

### Project Goals & Next Steps
The final deliverable will be a detailed markdown file summarizing our findings, supported by diagrams and data.
