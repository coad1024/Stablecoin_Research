This analysis answers the critical question: **"What is the cost of attack vs potential profits?"** for de-peg attacks on algorithmic stablecoins.

Our analysis reveals a **dramatic difference** between basic attack strategies and sophisticated financial engineering approaches:

- **Basic Attacks**: 0% economically viable scenarios
- **Enhanced Attacks**: 40-52% economically viable scenarios with ROI up to 3,496%

## Economic Viability by Approach

### Enhanced Cost-Benefit Analysis Results

| Approach | Viable Scenarios | Viability Rate | Max ROI | Min Attack Size | Avg Capital Required |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|---------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Working** | 33/72 | 45.8% | 3,496% | 0.5% | $4,118 |
| **Custom** | 48/120 | 40.0% | 1,051% | 1.0% | $13,766 |
| **Demo** | 62/120 | 51.7% | 537% | 0.5% | $13,766 |
| **Modular** | 0/120 | 0.0% | -101% | N/A | $13,766 |

## Attack Cost Structure

### Basic Attack Costs (Why Most Attacks Fail)
- **Capital Required**: 100% of attack amount
- **Transaction Fees**: 0.3% of capital
- **Borrowing Costs**: 5% annual rate
- **Risk Premium**: 2-12% based on attack size
- **Total Cost**: ~100.3% of attack amount

**Result**: Attacks lose money due to high capital requirements

### Enhanced Attack Costs (Sophisticated Strategies)
- **Capital Required**: Only 9% of attack amount (using flash loans & leverage)
- **Flash Loan Fees**: 0.09% of borrowed amount
- **Options Premiums**: 1.5% of attack amount
- **Margin Requirements**: 1.8% of attack amount  
- **Transaction Costs**: 0.5% of attack amount
- **Risk Premium**: 1% of attack amount

**Result**: Dramatically reduced capital requirements enable profitability

## Profit Mechanisms

### Basic Profit Sources (Conservative)
1. **Simple Arbitrage**: Buy low after depeg, sell at fair value
2. **Basic Short Selling**: Profit from price decline
3. **Limited Volume**: Constrained by available liquidity

**Typical Profit**: 2-5% of attack amount

### Enhanced Profit Sources (Sophisticated)
1. **Flash Loan Arbitrage**: No capital required, 2x attack volume
2. **Options Strategies**: 10x leverage on price movements
3. **Leveraged Short Selling**: 5x leverage on position
4. **Cross-Platform Arbitrage**: Exploit price differences across DEXs
5. **MEV Extraction**: Front-running and sandwich attacks
6. **Liquidity Pool Manipulation**: Strategic LP provision/withdrawal

**Typical Profit**: 20-180% of attack amount (when successful)

## Key Economic Findings

### 1. Capital Efficiency is Critical
- **Basic Strategy**: Requires $100 to make $5 profit (5% ROI)
- **Enhanced Strategy**: Requires $9 to make $20 profit (222% ROI)

### 2. Success Probability Matters Exponentially
| Breach Probability | Basic ROI | Enhanced ROI |
|-------------------|-----------|--------------|
| 20% | -95% | +140% |
| 40% | -90% | +315% |
| 90% | -60% | +700% |

### 3. Attack Size vs Profitability
- **Small Attacks** (0.5-1%): High ROI but lower absolute profits
- **Medium Attacks** (2.5-5%): Optimal risk-reward balance
- **Large Attacks** (>10%): Higher absolute profits but increased risk

### 4. Market Conditions Impact
- **Normal Markets**: 0-20% of scenarios profitable
- **Panic Markets**: 60-90% of scenarios profitable

---

## Attack Viability Matrix

### Most Profitable Scenarios
1. **Working Model + Panic + Slow Arbitrage + 0.5% Attack**
   - Capital Required: $45
   - Expected Profit: $1,619
   - ROI: 3,496%

2. **Working Model + Panic + Moderate Arbitrage + 1% Attack**
   - Capital Required: $90
   - Expected Profit: $799
   - ROI: 787%

3. **Demo Model + Panic + Slow Arbitrage + Various Sizes**
   - Consistent profitability across attack sizes
   - ROI range: 200-537%

### Least Vulnerable Systems
1. **Modular Approach**: 0% attack success rate
2. **Fast Arbitrage**: Rapid price correction prevents profits
3. **Large Pool Systems**: Higher absolute costs, similar relative profits

## Real-World Implications

### For Attackers
- **Sophisticated strategies are required** for profitability
- **Flash loans enable attacks** with minimal capital
- **Options and leverage multiply returns** significantly
- **Market timing is crucial** (panic conditions)

### For Protocol Designers
- **Fast arbitrage incentives** are critical defense
- **Multi-pool architectures** show superior resistance
- **Monitoring for sophisticated strategies** (not just large trades)
- **Circuit breakers during market stress**

### For Risk Management
- **Traditional analysis underestimates** attack profitability
- **Consider sophisticated attack vectors** in stress testing
- **Monitor options markets** for attack preparation signals
- **Flash loan monitoring** for rapid response

---

## Defensive Strategies

### Based on Economic Analysis

1. **Increase Attack Costs**
   - Flash loan fees during high volatility
   - Progressive transaction costs for large trades
   - Delays on large withdrawals

2. **Reduce Attack Profits**
   - Faster arbitrage incentives
   - Circuit breakers at price thresholds
   - MEV protection mechanisms

3. **Market Design**
   - Multi-pool architectures (proven most robust)
   - Virtual liquidity pools
   - Progressive stabilization mechanisms

## Conclusion

**The cost of attack vs potential profits reveals a sophisticated threat landscape:**

- Basic attacks are economically unviable
- **Enhanced attacks using flash loans, leverage, and options can be highly profitable**
- Attack viability ranges from 40-52% depending on system design
- **Maximum observed ROI: 3,496%** for small sophisticated attacks during market stress
- **Minimum capital required: $45** to potentially earn $1,619 profit

**Critical insight**: The gap between academic attack models and real-world financial engineering capabilities is enormous. Protocols must defend against sophisticated attackers, not just simple dump-and-arbitrage strategies.
