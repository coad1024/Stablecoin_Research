De-peg Attack Simulation Results Summary
=======================================

This document summarizes the results from our comprehensive de-peg attack simulation experiments
using four different approaches to model algorithmic stablecoin stability under attack scenarios.

Experiment Overview
------------------
- Pool Depths: $100k, $1M, $5M, $10M
- Attack Sizes: 0.5%, 1%, 2.5%, 5%, 10% of pool depth
- User Regimes: Normal (small random trades) vs Panic (net selling pressure)
- Arbitrage Modes: Fast (95% efficient), Moderate (50% efficient, 50% probability), Slow (30% efficient, 20% probability)
- Monte Carlo: 30 seeds per scenario (120 total scenarios per approach)
- Peg Breach: Price < $0.98 for 3+ consecutive ticks out of 50 total ticks

Approach Comparison
------------------

1. WORKING APPROACH (Simplified Price Model)
   - Implementation: Basic price simulation with regime-based noise
   - Minimum Attack Size for 50% Breach Probability: 2.5% across all pool depths
   - Characteristics: Shows consistent vulnerability patterns

2. DEMO APPROACH (Earlier Version)
   - Implementation: Previous iteration of simplified modeling
   - Minimum Attack Size for 50% Breach Probability: No scenarios reached 50% breach
   - Characteristics: More resistant to attacks than working approach

3. CUSTOM APPROACH (DualTokenSim Integration)
   - Implementation: Full integration with DualTokenSim liquidity pools and token mechanics
   - Minimum Attack Size for 50% Breach Probability: 5% across all pool depths
   - Characteristics: More robust than simplified models, requires larger attacks

4. MODULAR APPROACH (ThreePoolsSimulation Class)
   - Implementation: Uses complete ThreePoolsSimulation framework with virtual pools
   - Minimum Attack Size for 50% Breach Probability: No scenarios reached 50% breach
   - Characteristics: Most robust stabilization mechanisms

Key Findings
-----------

1. **Stabilization Mechanism Strength**: 
   Modular > Custom > Demo > Working
   
2. **Required Attack Sizes**:
   - Working: 2.5% of pool depth
   - Custom: 5% of pool depth  
   - Demo/Modular: >10% (no successful attacks observed)

3. **Pool Depth Effects**: 
   - In simpler models (Working/Custom), attack effectiveness is consistent across pool sizes
   - More complex models may have scale-dependent stabilization

4. **User Regime Sensitivity**:
   - Panic conditions (net selling pressure) increase vulnerability in all models
   - Normal market conditions provide more stability

5. **Arbitrage Efficiency Impact**:
   - Slower arbitrage increases attack success probability
   - Fast arbitrage provides strong stabilization

Technical Insights
-----------------

1. **Model Complexity Trade-offs**:
   - Simple models (Working) are easier to analyze but may underestimate stability
   - Complex models (Modular) include sophisticated stabilization but are harder to parameterize

2. **Free Supply Management**:
   - Token free supply constraints can cause simulation failures
   - Required large token supplies (10x pool depth) to handle attack scenarios

3. **Arbitrage Modeling**:
   - Critical component for stability analysis
   - Efficiency and probability parameters significantly affect outcomes

Implications for Stablecoin Design
---------------------------------

1. **Pool Depth**: While larger pools provide more liquidity, the relative attack size matters more than absolute pool size

2. **Arbitrage Incentives**: Fast and efficient arbitrage is crucial for maintaining peg stability

3. **Market Conditions**: Stablecoins are most vulnerable during panic conditions with net selling pressure

4. **Multi-Pool Architecture**: The ThreePoolsSimulation suggests that sophisticated multi-pool architectures with virtual pools provide superior stability

Recommendations for Further Research
----------------------------------

1. **Parameter Sensitivity**: Systematic analysis of arbitrage efficiency parameters
2. **Attack Strategies**: Model coordinated attacks and flash loan scenarios  
3. **Market Stress**: Extended analysis under various market stress conditions
4. **Real Data Validation**: Compare simulation results with historical depeg events
