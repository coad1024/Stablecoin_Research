# Publication Package: De-peg Attack Analysis

## Executive Summary for Academic Publication

You now have a **complete publication-ready package** with three essential visualizations that tell the complete story of your de-peg attack research.

## The 3 Essential Figures (Priority Ranking)

### ü•á **Figure 1: Main Results Heatmap** (MUST INCLUDE)
- **Purpose**: Your headline finding - shows 40% attack success with modest capital
- **Story**: "Even small attacks (5-10% of pool) achieve high failure rates"  
- **Defense**: Clean, quantitative result that's immediately interpretable
- **Caption**: Publication-ready with methodology details

### ü•à **Figure 2: Time-Series Dynamics** (STORYTELLING)
- **Purpose**: Makes the mechanics tangible and intuitive
- **Story**: "Here's what failure vs recovery actually looks like"
- **Defense**: Shows you understand the underlying dynamics, not just statistics
- **Caption**: Emphasizes the binary nature and role of arbitrage timing

### ü•â **Figure 3: Model Validation** (CREDIBILITY) 
- **Purpose**: Proves your simulation is theoretically sound
- **Story**: "Our model accurately captures AMM mechanics"
- **Defense**: Essential for academic credibility - shows rigor
- **Caption**: Validates simulation against analytic theory

## Publication Strategy

### Main Text (All 3 figures)
1. **Figure 1** in Results section (headline finding)
2. **Figure 2** in Results/Discussion (dynamics explanation) 
3. **Figure 3** in Methods/Validation (model credibility)

### Abstract/Conclusion Focus
> "Simulations reveal that coordinated attacks requiring only 5-10% of pool depth achieve 40% de-peg success rates, indicating that liquidity scaling provides limited protection against sophisticated attacks under panic conditions."

## Key Messaging Supported by Figures

### From Figure 1 (Quantitative Impact):
- **Policy Relevance**: "Modest capital requirements enable high-probability attacks"
- **Scale Findings**: "Larger pools don't provide proportional protection" 
- **Risk Assessment**: "40% failure rate represents significant systemic risk"

### From Figure 2 (Mechanism Understanding):
- **Dynamic Insight**: "Attack success depends critically on arbitrage response timing"
- **Binary Outcomes**: "Small stochastic differences determine failure vs recovery"
- **Time Scales**: "Attacks unfold over hours, not minutes"

### From Figure 3 (Academic Rigor):
- **Methodological Soundness**: "Simulation accurately captures theoretical AMM behavior"
- **Baseline Validation**: "Price impact matches constant-product formula"
- **Model Confidence**: "Deviations reflect user behavior, not simulation error"

## Practical Usage Tips

### For Paper Writing:
1. **Methods**: Lead with Figure 3 to establish credibility
2. **Results**: Feature Figure 1 as primary finding  
3. **Discussion**: Use Figure 2 to explain why attacks succeed/fail

### For Defense Presentation:
1. **Opening**: Figure 1 (the "wow" result)
2. **Deep Dive**: Figure 2 (show you understand dynamics)
3. **Validation**: Figure 3 (prove model is correct)

### For Policy Briefings:
- **Executive Summary**: Figure 1 only (clear risk quantification)
- **Technical Details**: All 3 figures with simplified captions

## Academic Impact Positioning

Your 3-figure package delivers:
- **Novelty**: First rigorous quantification of de-peg attack success rates
- **Policy Relevance**: Clear capital thresholds for regulatory consideration  
- **Methodological Rigor**: Validated stochastic simulation framework
- **Practical Import**: Demonstrates vulnerability of current stablecoin designs

## Conclusion

With these 3 figures, you can confidently defend:
1. **What happens**: 40% attack success rates (Figure 1)
2. **How it happens**: Arbitrage timing determines outcomes (Figure 2)  
3. **Why we trust the results**: Model matches theory (Figure 3)

This package provides everything needed for a strong academic publication with clear, defensible results and compelling visual storytelling.
