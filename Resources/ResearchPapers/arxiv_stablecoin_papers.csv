We discuss how stablecoins help reduce the volatility of cryptocurrencies by surveying different types of stablecoins and their stability mechanisms. We classify different approaches to stablecoins in three main categories i) fiat or asset backed, ii) crypto-collateralized and iii) algorithmic stablecoins, giving examples of concrete projects in each class. We assess the relative tradeoffs between the different approaches.

As algorithmic stablecoins have been growing rapidly in recent years, they become much more volatile than expected. In this paper, we took a deep dive into the core of algorithmic stablecoins and shared our answer to two fundamental research questions, i.e., Are algorithmic stablecoins volatile by design? Are they volatile in practice? Specifically, we introduced an in-depth study on three popular types of algorithmic stablecoins and developed a modeling framework to formalize their key design protocols. Through formal verification, the framework can identify critical conditions under which stablecoins might become volatile. Furthermore, we performed a systematic empirical analysis on real transaction activities of the Basis Cash stablecoin to relate theoretical possibilities to market observations.

We highlight each type's potential instabilities and underlying tradeoffs using agent-based simulations.

This attempt is important because there has been no preceding surveys focusing on the stablecoin as DPSs, i.e., the one aiming at not only price stabilization but also decentralization. Specifically, we first classified existing stablecoins into four types according to their collaterals (fiat, commodity, crypto, and non-collateralized) and pointed out the high potential of non-collateralized stablecoins as DPSs; then, we further classified existing non-collateralized stablecoins into two types according to their intervention layers (protocol, application) and confirmed details of their representative mechanisms. Utilizing concepts such as Quantity Theory of Money (QTM), Tobin tax, and speculative attack, our survey revealed the status quo where, despite the high potential of non-collateralized stablecoins, they have no standard mechanism to achieve the stablecoin for practical DPSs."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06037v2

However, UST is not the only stablecoin to have been depegged in the past. Designing resilient and long-term stable coins, therefore, appears to present a hard challenge.   To further scrutinize existing stablecoin designs and ultimately lead to more robust systems, we need to understand where volatility emerges. Our work provides a game-theoretical model aiming to help identify why stablecoins suffer from a depeg. This game-theoretical model reveals that stablecoins have different price equilibria depending on the coin's architecture and mechanism to minimize volatility. Moreover, our theory is supported by extensive empirical data, spanning $1$ year. To that end, we collect daily prices for 22 stablecoins and on-chain data from five blockchains including the Ethereum and the Terra blockchain."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11754v2

Building upon insights from previous stablecoin generations, JANUS leverages a dual-token system (Alpha and Omega), integrates crypto-assets and real-world assets (RWAs), employs a soft-peg mechanism, and utilizes AI-driven stabilization.   We provide a comprehensive theoretical framework, including formal definitions of D, E, and S, along with equilibrium existence proofs and analogies drawn from international trade and open-economy macroeconomics. By introducing a second token backed by external yield, JANUS breaks from ponzinomic dynamics and creates a more robust foundation. Multi-collateralization and a soft peg enable controlled price oscillations, while AI-driven parameter adjustments maintain equilibrium.   Through these innovations, JANUS aims to approach the center of the stablecoin trilemma, offering a globally resilient, inflation-adjusted, and decentralized stablecoin ecosystem bridging DeFi and TradFi. The main body presents a high-level overview of the trilemma and JANUS's key features, while the Appendix provides more formal mathematical treatments, including rigorous metrics for decentralization, capital efficiency, and stability, as well as the optimization challenges inherent in the trilemma."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18182v1

As fiat-referenced and programmable assets, stablecoins provide low-latency, globally interoperable infrastructure for payments, decentralized finance, DeFi, and tokenized commerce. Their accelerated adoption has prompted extensive regulatory engagement, exemplified by the European Union's Markets in Crypto-assets Regulation, MiCA, the US Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act, GENIUS Act, and Hong Kong's Stablecoins Bill. Despite this momentum, academic research remains fragmented across economics, law, and computer science, lacking a unified framework for design, evaluation, and application. This study addresses that gap through a multi-method research design. First, it synthesizes cross-disciplinary literature to construct a taxonomy of stablecoin systems based on custodial structure, stabilization mechanism, and governance. Second, it develops a performance evaluation framework tailored to diverse stakeholder needs, supported by an open-source benchmarking pipeline to ensure transparency and reproducibility. Third, a case study on Real World Asset tokenization illustrates how stablecoins operate as programmable monetary infrastructure in cross-border digital systems. By integrating conceptual theory with empirical tools, the paper contributes: a unified taxonomy for stablecoin design; a stakeholder-oriented performance evaluation framework; an empirical case linking stablecoins to sectoral transformation; and reproducible methods and datasets to inform future research. These contributions support the development of trusted, inclusive, and transparent digital monetary infrastructure."                                                                                                                       , http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02403v1

This primary market AMM (P-AMM) is an autonomous mechanism for pricing minting and redemption of stablecoins in all possible states and is designed to achieve several desirable properties. We first cover several case studies of current ad hoc stablecoin issuance and redemption mechanisms, several of which have contributed to recent stablecoin de-peggings, and formulate desirable properties of a P-AMM that support stability and usability. We then design a P-AMM redemption curve and show that it satisfies these properties, including bounded loss for both the protocol and stablecoin holders. We further show that this redemption curve is path independent and has properties of path deficiency in extended settings involving trading fees and a separate minting curve. This means that system health weakly improves relative to the path independent setting along any trading curve and that there is no incentive to strategically subdivide redemptions. Finally, we show how to implement the P-AMM efficiently on-chain."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12398v1

Stablecoins represent the most significant evolution in banking since the abandonment of the gold standard, positioned to enable ""Banking 2.0"" by seamlessly integrating cryptocurrency innovation with traditional finance infrastructure. This transformation rivals artificial intelligence as the next major disruptor in the financial sector. Modern fiat currencies derive value entirely from institutional trust rather than physical backing, creating vulnerabilities that stablecoins address through enhanced stability, reduced fraud risk, and unified global transactions that transcend national boundaries. Recent developments demonstrate accelerating institutional adoption: landmark U.S. legislation including the GENIUS Act of 2025, strategic industry pivots from major players like JPMorgan's crypto-backed loan initiatives, and PayPal's comprehensive ""Pay with Crypto"" service. Widespread stablecoin implementation addresses critical macroeconomic imbalances, particularly the inflation-productivity gap plaguing modern monetary systems, through more robust and diversified backing mechanisms. Furthermore, stablecoins facilitate deregulation and efficiency gains, paving the way for a more interconnected international financial system. This whitepaper comprehensively explores how stablecoins are poised to reshape banking, supported by real-world examples, current market data, and analysis of their transformative potential."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11395v1

Yet, despite their systemic importance, a comprehensive and risk-oriented understanding of crucial aspects like their design trade-offs, security dynamics, and interdependent failure pathways often remains underdeveloped. This SoK confronts this gap through a large-scale analysis of 157 research studies, 95 active stablecoins, and 44 major security incidents. Our analysis establishes four pivotal insights: 1) stability is best understood not an inherent property but an emergent, fragile state reliant on the interplay between market confidence and continuous liquidity; 2) stablecoin designs demonstrate trade-offs in risk specialization instead of mitigation; 3) the widespread integration of yield mechanisms imposes a ""dual mandate"" that creates a systemic tension between the core mission of stability and the high-risk financial engineering required for competitive returns; and 4) major security incidents act as acute ""evolutionary pressures"", forging resilience by stress-testing designs and aggressively redefining the security frontier. We introduce the Stablecoin LEGO framework, a quantitative methodology mapping historical failures to current designs. Its application reveals that a lower assessed risk strongly correlates with integrating lessons from past incidents. We hope this provides a systematic foundation for building, evaluating, and regulating more resilient stablecoins."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17622v1

Although academia has recognized the importance of stablecoins, research in this area remains fragmented, incomplete, and sometimes contradictory. In this paper, we aim to address the cited gap with a structured literature analysis, correlating recent contributions to present a picture of the complex economic, technical, and regulatory aspects of stablecoins.

Such stablecoins are popular methods for bootstrapping price stability within public blockchain settings. We derive fundamental results about dynamics and liquidity in stablecoin markets, demonstrate that these markets face deleveraging feedback effects that cause illiquidity during crises and exacerbate collateral drawdown, and characterize stable dynamics of the system under particular conditions. The possibility of such `deleveraging spirals' was first predicted in the initial release of our paper in 2019 and later directly observed during the `Black Thursday' crisis in Dai in 2020. From these insights, we suggest design improvements that aim to improve long-term stability. We also introduce new attacks that exploit arbitrage-like opportunities around stablecoin liquidations. Using our model, we demonstrate that these can be profitable. These attacks may induce volatility in the `stable' asset and cause perverse incentives for miners, posing risks to blockchain consensus. A variant of such attacks also later occurred during Black Thursday, taking the form of mempool manipulation to clear Dai liquidation auctions at near zero prices, costing $8m."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02152v3

These properties could only be attained by the novel and interdisciplinary combination of previously unrelated fields: model predictive control, deep learning, alternating direction method of multipliers (consensus-ADMM), mechanism design, secure multi-party computation, and zero-knowledge proofs. For the first time, this paper proves:   - the feasibility of decentralising the central bank while securely preserving its independence in a decentralised computation setting   - the benefits for price stability of combining mechanism design, provable security, and control theory, unlike the heuristics of previous stablecoins   - the implementation of complex monetary policies on a stablecoin, equivalent to the ones used by central banks and beyond the current fixed rules of cryptocurrencies that hinder their price stability   - methods to circumvent the impossibilities of Guaranteed Output Delivery (G.O.D.) and fairness: standing on truthfulness and faithfulness, we reach G.O.D. and fairness under the assumption of rational parties   As a corollary, a decentralised artificial intelligence is able to conduct the monetary policy of a stablecoin, minimising human intervention."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.07445v1

We develop a stochastic model that helps explain deleveraging crises in these over-collateralized systems. In our model, the stablecoin supply is decided by speculators who optimize the profitability of a leveraged position while incorporating the forward-looking cost of collateral liquidations, which involves the endogenous price of the stablecoin. We formally characterize regimes that are interpreted as stable and unstable for the stablecoin. We prove bounds on quadratic variation and the probability of large deviations in the stable domain and we demonstrate distinctly greater price variance in the unstable domain. We identify a deflationary deleveraging spiral by means of a submartingale. These deleveraging spirals, which resemble short squeezes, lead to faster collateral drawdown (and potential shortfalls) and are accompanied by higher price variance, as experienced on Black Thursday. We conclude by discussing non-custodial ways in which the issues raised in this paper can be mitigated."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01304v3

However, their risks vary significantly according to their design and are often poorly understood. We seek to provide a sound foundation for stablecoin theory, with a risk-based functional characterization of the economic structure of stablecoins. First, we match existing economic models to the disparate set of custodial systems. Next, we characterize the unique risks that emerge in non-custodial stablecoins and develop a model framework that unifies existing models from economics and computer science. We further discuss how this modeling framework is applicable to a wide array of cryptoeconomic systems, including cross-chain protocols, collateralized lending, and decentralized exchanges.

In crypto-backed stablecoins, the peg is founded on the guarantee that in case of system shutdown, each stablecoin can be exchanged for a basket of other crypto tokens worth approximately its nominal value. However, price fluctuations that affect the collateral tokens may cause this guarantee to be invalidated. In this work, we investigate the impact of the collateral portfolio's composition on the resilience to this type of catastrophic event. For stablecoins whose developers maintain a significant portion of the collateral (e.g., MakerDAO's Dai), we propose two portfolio optimization methods, based on convex optimization and (semi)variance minimization, that account for the correlation between the various token prices. We compare the optimal portfolios to the historical evolution of Dai's collateral portfolio, and to aid reproducibility, we have made our data and code publicly available."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08305v1

Using a global game which addresses both concerns, we show that the selling pressure on stablecoin holders increases in the presence of a large sale. While precise public knowledge reduces (increases) the probability of a run when fundamentals are strong (weak), interestingly, more precise private signals increase (reduce) the probability of a run when fundamentals are strong (weak), potentially explaining the stability of opaque stablecoins. The total run probability can be decomposed into components representing risks from large sales and poor collateral. By analyzing how these risk components vary with respect to information uncertainty and fundamentals, we can split the fundamental space into regions based on the type of risk a stablecoin issuer is more prone to.

The global DeFi ecosystem is fragmented into multiple blockchains, fueling the demand for cross-chain commerce. Existing approaches for cross-chain transactions, e.g., bridges and cross-chain deals, achieve atomicity by locking assets in escrow. However, locking up assets increases the financial risks for the participants, especially due to price fluctuations and the long latency of cross-chain transactions. Stablecoins, which are pegged to a non-volatile asset such as the US dollar, help mitigate the risk associated with price fluctuations. However, existing stablecoin designs are tied to individual blockchain platforms, and trusted parties or complex protocols are needed to exchange stablecoin tokens between blockchains.   Our goal is to design a practical stablecoin for cross-chain commerce. Realizing this goal requires addressing two challenges. The first challenge is to support a large and growing number of blockchains efficiently. The second challenge is to be resilient to price fluctuations and blockchain platform failures. We present CroCoDai to address these challenges. We also present three prototype implementations of our stablecoin system, and show that it incurs small execution overhead."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09754v4

This leads to fluctuating transaction fee prices and limits the flexibility of users' payment options. To address these issues, we propose MStableChain, which leverage multiple stablecoins as native tokens for transaction fee settlements, thus ensuring stable transaction fees and flexible payment options. To address the challenges of mass adoption and practicality, we propose several core designs. To maintain compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) for mass adoption while supporting multiple native stablecoins, MStableChain employs a multi-currency units, multi-type RPCs mechanism. This mechanism enables the system to handle multiple stablecoins without altering the EVM or requiring changes to user applications. Furthermore, an oracle-based gas fee adjustment mechanism is proposed to manage exchange rates between different stablecoins, ensuring equitable transaction costs across various currencies. The system also introduces a secure, on-chain voting-based management protocol for the administrative functions related to these stablecoins. Experimental results from a prototype implementation demonstrate that MStableChain provides stable transaction fee prices, high effectiveness, and good usability."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22100v2

This paper identifies the characteristics of stablecoins from an analytical perspective and investigates the role of stablecoins in forming hybrid monetary ecosystems where public (fiat, CBDC) and private (USDC, USDT, DAI) monies coexist. Through econometric analysis with multiple models, we find that stablecoins maintain strong peg stability, while each type also exhibits distinctive responses to market variables such as trading volume and capitalization, depending on the mechanisms behind. We introduce a hybrid system design that proposes a two-layer structure where private stablecoin issuers are backed by central bank reserves, ensuring uniformity, security, and programmability. This model merges the advantages of decentralized finance and payment innovation while utilizing the Federal Reserve's institutional trust. A case study on the 2023 SVB-USDC depeg event illustrates how such a hybrid system could prevent panic-induced instability through transparent reserves, secured liquidity, and interoperable assets. Ultimately, this research examines the model using the Dybvig model and Monte Carlo Simulation and concludes, with the results of the examinations, that a hybrid monetary model not only enhances financial inclusivity, scalability, and dollar utility in digital ecosystems but also strengthens systemic resilience, offering a credible blueprint for future digital dollar architectures."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10997v2

We observe a difference in TradFi market shocks impact between various stablecoins, in particular, USD Coin (USDC) and Tether USDT (USDT), the former with a higher reporting frequency and transparency than the latter. We investigate this, using top USDC and USDT liquidity pools in Uniswap, by adapting the Marginal Cost of Immediacy (MCI) measure to Uniswap's Automated Market Maker, and then conducting Difference-in-Differences analysis on MCI and Total Value Locked (TVL) in USD, as well as measuring liquidity concentration across different providers. Results show that the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) event reduced USDC's TVL dominance over USDT, increased USDT's liquidity cost relative to USDC, and liquidity provision remained concentrated with pool-specific trends. These findings reveal a flight-to-safety behavior and counterintuitive effects of stablecoin transparency: USDC's frequent and detailed disclosures led to swift market reactions, while USDT's opacity and less frequent reporting provided a safety net against immediate impacts."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11716v1

Designing resilient decentralized stablecoins is a challenge, and prominent stablecoins today either (i) give up on decentralization, or (ii) rely on user-owned cryptocurrencies as collateral, exposing the token to exogenous price fluctuations. In this latter category, it is increasingly common to employ algorithmic mechanisms to automate risk management, helping maintain the peg. One example of this is Reflexer's RAI, which adapts its system-internal exchange rate (redemption price) to secondary market conditions according to a proportional control law. In this paper, we take this idea of active management a step further, and introduce a new kind of control scheme based on a Stackelberg game model between the token protocol and its users. By doing so, we show that (i) we can mitigate adverse depeg events that inevitably arise in a fixed-redemption scheme such as MakerDao's DAI and (ii) generally outperform a simpler, adaptive-redemption scheme such as RAI in the task of targeting a desired market price. We demonstrate these results through extensive simulations over a range of market conditions."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21446v1

This paper provides a theoretical and applied analysis of how fiat-collateralized stablecoins, a class of digital currency pegged to a stable asset like the U.S. dollar, can address these long-standing challenges. We develop a farm-level profit maximization model incorporating transaction costs and credit constraints to demonstrate how stablecoins can enhance economic outcomes by (1) reducing the costs and risks of cross-border trade, (2) improving the efficiency and transparency of supply chain finance through smart contracts, and (3) expanding access to credit for smallholder farmers. We analyze key use cases, including parametric insurance and trade finance, while also considering the significant hurdles to adoption, such as regulatory uncertainty and the digital divide. The paper concludes that while not a panacea, stablecoins represent a significant financial technology with the potential to catalyze a paradigm shift in agricultural economics, warranting further empirical investigation and policy support."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14970v1

They stand to revolutionize the way a sovereign fiat operates. As implemented, these coins are poorly stabilized in most cases, easily deviating from the price target or even falling into a catastrophic collapse (a.k.a. Death spiral), and are as a result dismissed as a Ponzi scheme. However, is this the whole picture? In this paper, we try to reveal the truth and clarify such a deceptive concept. We find that Ponzi is basically a financial protocol that pays existing investors with funds collected from new ones. Running a Ponzi, however, does not necessarily imply that any participant is in any sense losing out, as long as the game can be perpetually rolled over. Economists call such realization as a \textit{rational Ponzi game}. We thereby propose a rational model in the context of AS and draw its holding conditions. We apply the model to examine: \textit{whether or not the algorithmic stablecoin is a rational Ponzi game.} Accordingly, we discuss two types of algorithmic stablecoins (\text{Rebase} \& \text{Seigniorage shares}) and dig into the historical market performance of two impactful projects (\text{Ampleforth} \& \text{TerraUSD}, respectively) to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11928v2
Real-time Risk Metrics for Programmatic Stablecoin Crypto   Asset-Liability Management (CALM)                                                                           , "Marcel Bluhm, Adrian Cachinero Vasiljević, Sébastien Derivaux, Søren Terp Hørlück Jessen"                                                                                        , 2024-01-24T11:53:53Z, "Stablecoins have turned out to be the ""killer"" use case of the growing digital asset space. However, risk management frameworks, including regulatory ones, have been largely absent. In this paper, we address the critical question of measuring and managing risk in stablecoin protocols, which operate on public blockchain infrastructure. The on-chain environment makes it possible to monitor risk and automate its management via transparent smart-contracts in real-time. We propose two risk metrics covering capitalization and liquidity of stablecoin protocols. We then explore in a case-study type analysis how our risk management framework can be applied to DAI, the biggest decentralized stablecoin by market capitalisation to-date, governed by MakerDAO. Based on our findings, we recommend that the protocol explores implementing automatic capital buffer adjustments and dynamic maturity gap matching. Our analysis demonstrates the practical benefits for scalable (prudential) risk management stemming from real-time availability of high-quality, granular, tamper-resistant on-chain data in the digital asset space. We name this approach Crypto Asset-Liability Management (CALM)."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13399v1

By Q1 2025, Tether directly held approximately $98.5 billion in U.S. Treasury bills, representing 1.6% of all outstanding Treasury bills, making it one of the largest non-sovereign buyers in this crucial asset class, on par with nation-state-level investors. This paper investigates how Tether's market share of U.S. Treasury bills influences corresponding yields. The baseline semi-log time trend model finds that a 1% increase in Tether's market share is associated with a 1-month yield reduction of 3.8%, corresponding to 14-16 basis points. However, threshold regression analysis reveals a critical market share threshold of 0.973%, above which the yield impact intensifies significantly. In this high regime, a 1% market share increase reduces 1-month yields by 6.3%. At the end of Q1 2025, Tether's market share placed it firmly within this high-impact regime, reducing 1-month yields by around 24 basis points relative to a counterfactual. In absolute terms, Tether's demand for Treasury Bills equates to roughly $15 billion in annual interest savings for the U.S. government. Aligning with theories of liquidity saturation and nonlinear price impact, these results highlight that stablecoin demand can reduce sovereign funding costs and provide a potential buffer against market shocks."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12413v1

Consequently, during the last two years, multiple so called stablecoins have surfaced---cryptocurrencies focused on maintaining stable exchange rates. In this paper, we systematically explore and analyze the stablecoin landscape. Based on a survey of 24 specific stablecoin projects, we go beyond individual coins for extracting general concepts and approaches. We combine our findings with learnings from classical monetary policy, resulting in a comprehensive taxonomy of cryptocurrency stabilization. We use our taxonomy to highlight the current state of development from different perspectives and show blank spots. For instance, while over 91% of projects promote 1-to-1 stabilization targets to external assets, monetary policy literature suggests that the smoothing of short term volatility is often a more sustainable alternative. Our taxonomy bridges computer science and economics, fostering the transfer of expertise. For example, we find that 38% of the reviewed projects use a combination of exchange rate targeting and specific stabilization techniques that can render them vulnerable to speculative economic attacks - an avoidable design flaw."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11905v1

We show that the distributional and dynamic properties of Tether/USD rates have been evolving from 2017 to 2021. We use local analysis methods to detect and describe the local patterns, such as short-lived trends, time-varying volatility and persistence. To accommodate these patterns, we consider a time varying parameter Double Autoregressive tvDAR(1) model under the assumption of local stationarity of Tether/USD rates. We estimate the tvDAR model non-parametrically and test hypotheses on the functional parameters. In the application to Tether, the model provides a good fit and reliable out-of-sample forecasts at short horizons, while being robust to time-varying persistence and volatility. In addition, the model yields a simple plug-in measure of stability for Tether and other stablecoins for assessing and comparing their stability."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00509v1

These issues deter contributors and entrepreneurs from effectively leveraging crowdfunding for innovation and growth. Blockchain technology introduces decentralization, security, and efficiency to address these limitations (1). This paper proposes a blockchain-based crowdfunding framework that integrates stablecoins such as USDT and USDC to mitigate cryptocurrency volatility and ensure seamless fund management. Smart contracts automate compliance processes, including Know Your Customer (KYC) / Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks, and enhance operational efficiency (2). Furthermore, tokenization enables liquidity by allowing fractional ownership and secondary market trading, which must be effectively implemented on any global market platform. A comparative analysis highlights the superiority of the framework over traditional platforms in terms of cost reduction, transparency, and investor trust. A case study focused on the Turkish market illustrates the practical benefits of blockchain adoption in equity crowdfunding, particularly in navigating local regulatory and financial complexities. This approach provides a scalable, secure, and accessible solution for modern crowdfunding ecosystems, while reducing the costs of platforms and increasing the trust of investors and backers in crowdfunding projects.

However, many concerns regarding the credibility of these offsetting claims have been raised. Moreover, the credit market is manual, therefore inefficient and unscalable, and non-fungible, therefore illiquid. To address these issues, we propose an efficient digital methodology that combines remote sensing data, modern econometric techniques, and on-chain certification and trading to create a new digital carbon asset (the PACT stablecoin) against which carbon offsetting claims can be transparently verified. PACT stablecoins are produced as outputs from a reproducible computational pipeline for estimating the climate benefits of carbon offset projects that not only quantifies the CO2 emissions involved, but also allows for similar credits to be pooled based on their co-benefits such as biodiversity and jurisdictional attributes, increasing liquidity through fungibility within pools. We implement and evaluate the PACT carbon stablecoin on the Tezos blockchain, which is designed to facilitate low-cost transactions while minimizing environmental impact. Our implementation includes a contract for a registry for tracking issuance, ownership, and retirement of credits, and a custodian contract to bridge on-chain and off-chain transactions. Our work brings scale and trust to the voluntary carbon market by providing a transparent, scalable, and efficient framework for high integrity carbon credit transactions."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14581v2

We train and test our changepoint detection algorithm against Curve LP token prices for 13 StableSwap pools throughout 2022 and 2023, focusing on relevant stablecoin and LSD depegs.

We examine the class of crypto-backed stable derivatives, with a focus on mechanisms for price stabilization, which is exemplified by the well-known stablecoin DAI from MakerDAO. For simplicity, we focus on a single-collateral setting. We introduce a belief parameter to the simulation model of DAI in a previous work (DAISIM), reflecting market sentiments about the value and stability of DAI, and show that it better matches the expected behavior when this parameter is set to a sufficiently high value. We also propose a simple mathematical model of DAI price to explain its stability and dependency on ETH price.

Cryptocurrencies are characterised by high market volatility and susceptibility to substantial crashes, issues that require temporal analysis methodologies able to tackle the high temporal resolution, heterogeneity and scale of blockchain data. While existing research attempts to analyse crash events, fundamental questions persist regarding the optimal time scale for analysis, differentiation between long-term and short-term trends, and the identification and characterisation of shock events within these decentralised systems. This paper addresses these issues by examining cryptocurrencies traded on the Ethereum blockchain, with a spotlight on the crash of the stablecoin TerraUSD and the currency LUNA designed to stabilise it. Utilising complex network analysis and a multi-layer temporal graph allows the study of the correlations between the layers representing the currencies and system evolution across diverse time scales. The investigation sheds light on the strong interconnections among stablecoins pre-crash and the significant post-crash transformations. We identify anomalous signals before, during, and after the collapse, emphasising their impact on graph structure metrics and user movement across layers. This paper pioneers temporal, cross-chain graph analysis to explore a cryptocurrency collapse. It emphasises the importance of temporal analysis for studies on web-derived data and how graph-based analysis can enhance traditional econometric results. Overall, this research carries implications beyond its field, for example for regulatory agencies aiming to safeguard users from shocks and monitor investment risks for citizens and clients."                    , http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10614v2

DeFi compositions may impact the development of ecosystem interoperability, are increasingly integrated with web technologies, and may introduce risks through complexity. Starting from a dataset of 23 labeled DeFi protocols and 10,663,881 associated Ethereum accounts, we study the interactions of protocols and associated smart contracts. From a network perspective, we find that decentralized exchanges and lending protocols have high degree and centrality values, that interactions among protocol nodes primarily occur in a strongly connected component, and that known community detection methods cannot disentangle DeFi protocols. Therefore, we propose an algorithm to decompose a protocol call into a nested set of building blocks that may be part of other DeFi protocols. With a ground truth dataset we have collected, we can demonstrate the algorithm's capability by finding that swaps are the most frequently used building blocks. As building blocks can be nested, i.e., contained in each other, we provide visualizations of composition trees for deeper inspections. We also present a broad picture of DeFi compositions by extracting and flattening the entire nested building block structure across multiple DeFi protocols. Finally, to demonstrate the practicality of our approach, we present a case study that is inspired by the recent collapse of the UST stablecoin in the Terra ecosystem. Under the hypothetical assumption that the stablecoin USD Tether would experience a similar fate, we study which building blocks and, thereby, DeFi protocols would be affected. Overall, our results and methods contribute to a better understanding of a new family of financial products."                                        , http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11933v2

However, blockchain-based governance structures have challenges, mostly notably, the need to align the short-term outlook of pseudononymous voters with the long-term growth and success of the decentralised organisation. The Vote-Escrowed Token (veToken) model attempts to resolve this tension by requiring voters to escrow or lock tokens of value for an extended period in exchange for voting weight.   In this paper, we describe the veToken model and analyse its emergent outcomes. We show that voting behaviour follows bribes set by higher-level protocols, and that the cost per vote varies depending on how it is acquired. We describe the implementation of the veToken model by Curve Finance, a popular automated market maker for stablecoins, and the ecosystem of protocols that has arisen on top of this implementation. We show that voting markets such as Votium largely determine the outcome of fortnightly votes held by Convex Finance, and we show that Frax Finance, a stablecoin issuer, plays a central role in the ecosystem even though they directly lock relatively few tokens with Curve. Instead, they indirectly lock tokens through yield aggregators such as Convex Finance and purchase voting weight through voting markets such as Votium.   Although the veToken model in isolation is straight-forward and easily explained, it leads to many complex and emergent outcomes. Decentralised organisations should consider these outcomes before adopting the model."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17589v1
Heterogeneous Exposures to Systematic and Idiosyncratic Risk across   Crypto Assets: A Divide-and-Conquer Approach                                                      , "Nektarios Aslanidis, Aurelio Bariviera, George Kapetanios, Vasilis Sarafidis"                                                                                                    , 2025-06-26T08:54:03Z, "This paper analyzes realized return behavior across a broad set of crypto assets by estimating heterogeneous exposures to idiosyncratic and systematic risk. A key challenge arises from the latent nature of broader economy-wide risk sources: macro-financial proxies are unavailable at high-frequencies, while the abundance of low-frequency candidates offers limited guidance on empirical relevance. To address this, we develop a two-stage ``divide-and-conquer'' approach. The first stage estimates exposures to high-frequency idiosyncratic and market risk only, using asset-level IV regressions. The second stage identifies latent economy-wide factors by extracting the leading principal component from the model residuals and mapping it to lower-frequency macro-financial uncertainty and sentiment-based indicators via high-dimensional variable selection. Structured patterns of heterogeneity in exposures are uncovered using Mean Group estimators across asset categories. The method is applied to a broad sample of crypto assets, covering more than 80% of total market capitalization. We document short-term mean reversion and significant average exposures to idiosyncratic volatility and illiquidity. Green and DeFi assets are, on average, more exposed to market-level and economy-wide risk than their non-Green and non-DeFi counterparts. By contrast, stablecoins are less exposed to idiosyncratic, market-level, and economy-wide risk factors relative to non-stablecoins. At a conceptual level, our study develops a coherent framework for isolating distinct layers of risk in crypto markets. Empirically, it sheds light on how return sensitivities vary across digital asset categories -- insights that are important for both portfolio design and regulatory oversight."                                                                                                                                                    , http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21100v1
Cost-Effective Data Feeds to Blockchains via Workload-Adaptive Data   Replication                                                                                       , "Kai Li, Yuzhe Tang, Jiaqi Chen, Zhehu Yuan, Cheng Xu, Jianliang Xu"                                                                                                              , 2019-11-11T05:08:41Z, "Feeding external data to a blockchain, a.k.a. data feed, is an essential task to enable blockchain interoperability and support emerging cross-domain applications, notably stablecoins. Given the data-intensive feeds in real life (e.g., high-frequency price updates) and the high cost in using blockchain, namely Gas, it is imperative to reduce the Gas cost of data feeds. Motivated by the constant-changing workloads in finance and other applications, this work focuses on designing a dynamic, workload-aware approach for cost effectiveness in Gas. This design space is understudied in the existing blockchain research which has so far focused on static data placement.   This work presents GRuB, a cost-effective data feed that dynamically replicates data between the blockchain and an off-chain cloud storage. GRuB's data replication is workload-adaptive by monitoring the current workload and making online decisions w.r.t. data replication. A series of online algorithms are proposed that achieve the bounded worst-case cost in blockchain's Gas. GRuB runs the decision-making components on the untrusted cloud off-chain for lower Gas costs, and employs a security protocol to authenticate the data transferred between the blockchain and cloud. The overall GRuB system can autonomously achieve low Gas costs with changing workloads.   We built a GRuB prototype functional with Ethereum and Google LevelDB, and supported real applications in stablecoins. Under real workloads collected from the Ethereum contract-call history and mixed workloads of YCSB, we systematically evaluate GRuB's cost which shows a saving of Gas by 10% ~ 74%, with comparison to the baselines of static data-placement."                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.04078v3

Compound and Aave are two of the most important application in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Using publicly available information on rates, supply and borrow activity, and accounts we analyze different elements of the protocols. In particular, we estimate ex-post margins that give a comprehensive account of the cost of financial intermediation. We find that ex-post margins considering all markets are 1% and lower for stablecoin markets. In addition, we estimate quarterly indicators regarding solvency, asset quality, earnings and market risk similar to the ones used in traditional banking.

We developed an agent-based simulation that emulates both the Maker protocol smart contract logic, and how profit-motivated agents (""keepers"") will act in the real world when faced with decisions such as liquidating ""vaults"" (collateralized debt positions) and bidding on collateral auctions. This research focuses on the incentive structure introduced in Liquidations 2.0, which implements both a constant fee (tip) and a fee proportional to vault size (chip) paid to keepers that liquidate vaults or restart stale collateral auctions. We sought to minimize the amount paid in incentives while maximizing the speed with which undercollateralized vaults were liquidated. Our findings indicate that it is more cost-effective to increase the constant fee, as opposed to the proportional fee, in order to decrease the time it takes for keepers to liquidate vaults."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03519v1

We examine a natural experiment that exogenously stress tests this alternative paradigm by revealing the identities of individuals associated with a DeFi protocol, including a convicted criminal. We find that, in practice, DeFi does not (yet) fully remove the need for trust in individuals. Our findings suggest that that because smart contracts are incomplete, they are subject to run risk (Allen and Gale, 2004) and personal character and trust of individuals are still relevant in this alternative financial system."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06285v1

We do not address the normative question whether a central bank should issue a central bank digital currency (CBDC) or not. Instead, we contribute to the current research debate by showing how a central bank could do so, if desired. We propose a token-based system without distributed ledger technology and show how earlier-deployed, software-only electronic cash can be improved upon to preserve transaction privacy, meet regulatory requirements in a compelling way, and offer a level of quantum-resistant protection against systemic privacy risk. Neither monetary policy nor financial stability would be materially affected because a CBDC with this design would replicate physical cash rather than bank deposits."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00254v1

Decentralized Finance (DeFi), however, is making its debut as an ecosystem claiming to offer transparency and control, which are partially attributable to the underlying integrity-protected blockchain, as well as currently higher financial asset yields than CeFi. Yet, the boundaries between CeFi and DeFi may not be always so clear cut.   In this work, we systematically analyze the differences between CeFi and DeFi, covering legal, economic, security, privacy and market manipulation. We provide a structured methodology to differentiate between a CeFi and a DeFi service. Our findings show that certain DeFi assets (such as USDC or USDT stablecoins) do not necessarily classify as DeFi assets, and may endanger the economic security of intertwined DeFi protocols. We conclude this work with the exploration of possible synergies between CeFi and DeFi."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08157v2

In the digital era, many non-physical currencies have either entered circulation or are under development, including demand deposits, cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), in-game currencies, and quantum money. These forms of money have novel properties that have not been studied extensively within the economics literature, but may be important determinants of the monetary equilibrium that emerges in the forthcoming era of heightened currency competition. This paper makes the first exhaustive attempt to identify and define the properties of all physical and digital forms of money. It reviews both the economics and computer science literatures and categorizes properties within an expanded version of the original functions-and-properties framework of money that includes societal and regulatory objectives."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.04483v2

We analyze the governance characteristics in the Maker protocol, its stablecoin DAI and governance token Maker (MKR). To achieve that, we establish several measurements of centralized governance. Our empirical analysis investigates the effect of centralized governance over a series of factors related to MKR and DAI, such as financial, transaction, network and twitter sentiment indicators. Our results show that governance centralization influences both the Maker protocol, and the distribution of voting power matters. The main implication of this study is that centralized governance in MakerDAO very much exists, while DeFi investors face a trade-off between decentralization and performance of a DeFi protocol. This further contributes to the contemporary debate on whether DeFi can be truly decentralized. centralized governance in MakerDAO very much exists, while DeFi investors face a trade-off between efficiency and decentralization.

Latency on the blockchain, however, has prevented decentralized exchanges (DEXes) from utilizing the order book mechanism and instead gave rise to the development of market designs that are better suited to a blockchain. Although the first widely popularized DEX, Uniswap V2, stood out through its astonishing simplicity, a recent design overhaul introduced with Uniswap V3 has introduced increasing levels of complexity aiming to increase capital efficiency.   In this work, we empirically study the ability of Unsiwap V3 to handle unexpected price shocks. Our analysis finds that the prices on Uniswap V3 were inaccurate during the recent abrupt price drops of two stablecoins: UST and USDT. We identify the lack of agility required of Unsiwap V3 liquidity providers as the root cause of these worrying price inaccuracies. Additionally, we outline that there are too few incentives for liquidity providers to enter liquidity pools, given the elevated volatility in such market conditions."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09642v2

Eisenberg attempted to short the CRV token by using funds borrowed on the protocol to artificially deflate the value of CRV. While the attack was ultimately unsuccessful, it left the Aave community scared and even raised question marks regarding the feasibility of large lending platforms under decentralized governance.   In this work, we analyze Avi Eisenberg's actions and show how he was able to artificially lower the price of CRV by selling large quantities of borrowed CRV for stablecoins on both decentralized and centralized exchanges. Despite the failure of his attack, it still led to irretrievable debt worth more than 1.5 Mio USD at the time and, thereby, quadrupled the protocol's irretrievable debt. Furthermore, we highlight that his attack was enabled by the vast proportion of CRV available to borrow as well as Aave's lending protocol design hindering rapid intervention. We stress Eisenberg's attack exposes a predicament of large DeFi lending protocols: limit the scope or compromise on 'decentralization'."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04068v2

A comprehensive and in-depth evaluation of lending protocol is essential to the DeFi market participants. Due to the short development time of DeFi, the current evaluation is limited to the single evaluation indicator, such as total locked value (TVL). To our knowledge, we are the first to study the evaluation model for DeFi lending protocol. In this paper, we build a four-layer lending protocol evaluation model based on Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The model contains three first-level indicators and ten second-level indicators, covering various aspects of the performance of lending protocol. We calculated these indicators by obtaining on-chain and off-chain data of lending protocol. Then we evaluated and ranked six mainstream lending protocols utilizing the proposed model during the period 2021/8/20-2022/11/10. Through comparative analysis of evaluation result, we found that the violent decline in the price of ETH increase the market share of stablecoin in the lending protocols.

However, these properties do not always generalize to a setting across multiple independent blockchains. Despite the growing number of existing blockchain platforms, there is a lack of an overarching framework whose components provide all of the necessary properties for practical cross-chain commerce. We present BlockChain I/O to provide such a framework. BlockChain I/O introduces entities called cross-chain services to relay information between different blockchains. The proposed design ensures that cross-chain services cannot violate transaction safety, and they are furthermore disincentivized from other types of misbehavior through an audit system. BlockChain I/O uses native stablecoins to mitigate price fluctuations, and a decentralized ID system to allow users to prove aspects of their identity without violating privacy. After presenting the core architecture of BlockChain I/O, we demonstrate how to use it to implement a cross-chain marketplace and discuss how its desirable properties continue to hold in the end-to-end system. Finally, we use experimental evaluations to demonstrate BlockChain I/O's practical performance."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02163v3

Tagging fungible tokens with metadata is not a new problem and was first formalized in the Colored Coins protocol. In certain contexts, practical solutions to this challenge have been implemented and deployed such as NFT. We define the fungible token coloring problem, one specific aspect of the Colored Coins problem, to be the problem of retaining fungible characteristics of the underlying token while accurately tracking the attribution of fungible tokens to their respective minters.

The task becomes even more arduous when applied to cryptocurrency returns, given the chaotic and intricately complex nature of crypto markets. In this study, we present a novel prediction algorithm using limit order book (LOB) data rooted in the Hawkes model, a category of point processes. Coupled with a continuous output error (COE) model, our approach offers a precise forecast of return signs by leveraging predictions of future financial interactions. Capitalizing on the non-uniformly sampled structure of the original time series, our strategy surpasses benchmark models in both prediction accuracy and cumulative profit when implemented in a trading environment. The efficacy of our approach is validated through Monte Carlo simulations across 50 scenarios. The research draws on LOB measurements from a centralized cryptocurrency exchange where the stablecoin Tether is exchanged against the U.S. dollar."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16190v1

By employing blockchain for security and integrity, DeFi creates new possibilities that attract retail and institution users, including central banks. Given its novel applications and sophisticated designs, the distinction between DeFi services and understanding the risk involved is often complex. This work systematically presents the major categories of DeFi protocols that cover over 90\% of total value locked (TVL) in DeFi. It establishes a structured methodology to differentiate between DeFi protocols based on their design and architecture. Every DeFi protocol is classified into one of three groups: liquidity pools, pegged and synthetic tokens, and aggregator protocols, followed by risk analysis. In particular, we classify stablecoins, liquid staking tokens, and bridged (wrapped) assets as pegged tokens resembling similar risks. The full risk exposure of DeFi users is derived not only from the DeFi protocol design but also from how it is used and with which tokens."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11281v1

Our approach employs multi-level nested Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes, for which we derive key properties and develop calibration and filtering techniques. Then, we design an automated market maker (AMM) model specifically tailored for the swapping of closely related cryptoassets. Distinct from existing models, our AMM leverages the unique exchange rate dynamics provided by the multi-level nested OU processes, enabling more precise risk management and enhanced liquidity provision. We validate the model through numerical simulations using real-world data for the USDC/USDT and wstETH/WETH pairs, demonstrating that it consistently yields efficient quotes.

Bitcoin responds positively to USDT minting events over 5- to 30-minute event windows, but this response begins declining after 60 minutes.

Unlike Bitcoin's fixed-supply volatility, stablecoins' dependence on fiat trust, or central bank digital currencies' jurisdictional limits, QRT uses quantum computing power as a novel value anchor.

We present a hybrid stabilization protocol that combines crypto-collateralized reserves, algorithmic futures contracts, and cross-chain liquidity pools to achieve robust price adherence while preserving user privacy. At its core, the protocol introduces stabilization futures contracts (SFCs), non-collateralized derivatives that programmatically incentivize third-party arbitrageurs to counteract price deviations via adaptor signature atomic swaps. Autonomous AI agents optimize delta hedging across decentralized exchanges (DEXs), while zkSNARKs prove compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) regulations without exposing identities or transaction details. Our cryptographic design reduces cross-chain liquidity concentration (Herfindahl-Hirschman Index: 2,400 vs. 4,900 in single-chain systems) and ensures atomicity under standard cryptographic assumptions.

This paper investigates how individual Ethereum wallets responded to the collapse of FTX, one of the largest centralized cryptocurrency exchanges. Moving beyond price-based event studies, we adopt a bottom-up approach using granular wallet-level data. We construct a representative sample of Ethereum addresses and analyze their transaction behavior before and after the collapse using an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) framework. Our proposed framework addresses data scarcity in high-resolution wallet-level daily transactions by employing a calibrated zero-inflated generalized linear fixed effects model. Our analysis quantifies distinct shifts in transaction intensity and stablecoin usage, highlighting a flight to safety within the ecosystem.

We give an overview of current solutions that differ in their fundamental values and technological possibilities, like e.g. private-issued stablecoins, DLT-issued electronic money and genuine cryptocurrencies. Based on this analysis, we present the concept of justified trust and propose to combine the strengths of the crypto based, decentralized trustless elements with established and well regulated means of payment, based on this concept, via a secure external re-balancing interface.   Combining the advantages, e.g. lightweight, trustless, efficient high frequency micro state transfers on the one hand, and ease of use, widely spread, accepted alignment to a multitude of regulative requirements, on the other hand, while neither leading into a lock-in in any of the proposed solutions, nor undermining the basic principles of the crypto-movement or unnecessarily reinforcing the banking system provides a synergy and the necessary flexibility for further evolution alongside the regulative framework. This offers a regulation conform transitional solution that can be implemented in the short term, which enables companies to place their decentralized business operations in a regulated environment.

Nonetheless, factors such as price volatility may undermine this mechanism. In order to protect protocols from suffering losses, undercollateralized positions can be liquidated. In this paper, we present the first in-depth empirical analysis of liquidations on protocols for loanable funds (PLFs). We examine Compound, one of the most widely used PLFs, for a period starting from its conception to September 2020. We analyze participants' behavior and risk-appetite in particular, to elucidate recent developments in the dynamics of the protocol. Furthermore, we assess how this has changed with a modification in Compound's incentive structure and show that variations of only 3% in an asset's dollar price can result in over 10m USD becoming liquidable. To further understand the implications of this, we investigate the efficiency of liquidators. We find that liquidators' efficiency has improved significantly over time, with currently over 70% of liquidable positions being immediately liquidated. Lastly, we provide a discussion on how a false sense of security fostered by a misconception of the stability of non-custodial stablecoins, increases the overall liquidation risk faced by Compound participants."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13235v6

By employing core functions of the 'Dai Stablecoin system' deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, we produce the equivalent exposure of a leveraged position while deterministically automating the monitoring and liquidation processes. We demonstrate the implementation and early integration of the artefact into a hardened exchange environment through a microservice utilizing standardized API calls. The early results presented in this paper were produced in collaboration with a team of stakeholders at a hosting organization, a multi-national online brokerage and cryptocurrency exchange. We utilize the design science research methodology (DSR) guiding the design, development, and evaluation of the artefact. Our findings indicate that, while it is feasible to implement the lifecycle of a leveraged trade on the blockchain, the integration of the artefact into a traditional exchange environment involves multiple compromises and drawback. Generalizing the tentative findings presented in this paper, we introduce three propositions on the implementation, integration, and implications of executing key business processes with permissionless blockchain technologies.

As the number of DLT networks increases, each with varying design characteristics, the likelihood that transacting parties are on the same network decreases. Thus, it is crucial to facilitate payments that are universal across networks, scalable to massive loads, and highly available. We envision a future payment network that may be built on top of DLT networks without being subject to their limitations on interoperability, scalability, and availability faced by DLT payment solutions today. Specifically, we propose a hub-and-spoke payment route, referred to here as Universal Payment Channels (UPC), that can be used to support digital token transfers of funds across different networks through payment channels. We further discuss the potential use cases of the UPC technology to support, and not complicate, an already robust digital payment ecosystem. Finally, through the paper, we share some future directions of the UPC technology."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12194v2

Yet, a unified definition for decentralization remains elusive. Our Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) seeks to bridge this gap, emphasizing quantification and methodological coherence. We've formulated a taxonomy defining blockchain decentralization across five facets: consensus, network, governance, wealth, and transaction. Despite the prevalent focus on consensus decentralization, our novel index, based on Shannon entropy, provides comprehensive insights. Moreover, we delve into alternative metrics like the Gini and Nakamoto Coefficients and the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), supplemented by an open-source Python tool on GitHub. In terms of methodology, blockchain research has often bypassed stringent scientific methods. By employing descriptive, predictive, and causal methods, our study showcases the potential of structured research in blockchain. Descriptively, we observe a trend of converging decentralization levels over time. Examining DeFi platforms reveals exchange and lending applications as more decentralized than their payment and derivatives counterparts. Predictively, there's a notable correlation between Ether's returns and transaction decentralization in Ether-backed stablecoins. Causally, Ethereum's transition to the EIP-1559 transaction fee model has a profound impact on DeFi transaction decentralization. To conclude, our work outlines directions for blockchain research, emphasizing the delicate balance among decentralization facets, fostering long-term decentralization, and the ties between decentralization, security, privacy, and efficiency.

It is extremely efficiently transferable and, most importantly, transactional or, more generally, contract-backed. This facilitates fully automated, guaranteed transactional execution of atomic resource exchanges and more complex contracts, without a multitude of intermediaries and expensive or slow semi-manual processes.   A didactic objective is separating money characteristics from technology aspects such as specific blockchain and distributed ledger systems to help disentangle discussions of digital money design from implementation techniques.   We finally discuss the power and role of programmable (contract-backed) digital money in case studies: tokenization of invoice debt using smart contracts on Ethereum, with stablecoins serving as digital money; smart contracts for disbursing payments transparently and reliably in accordance with social legislation; and a Danish e-krone for crowdfunding public and private community projets.

Following Ethereum's transition from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS), the Proposer Builder Separation (PBS) mechanism has emerged as the dominant force in the Ethereum block construction market.   This paper presents an in-depth longitudinal study of the Ethereum block construction market, spanning from the introduction of PoS and PBS in September 2022 to May 2023. We analyze the market shares of builders and relays, their temporal changes, and the financial dynamics within the PBS system, including payments among builders and block proposers -- commonly referred to as bribes. We introduce an MEV-time law quantifying the expected MEV revenue wrt. the time elapsed since the last proposed block. We provide empirical evidence that moments of crisis (e.g. the FTX collapse, USDC stablecoin de-peg) coincide with significant spikes in MEV payments compared to the baseline.   Despite the intention of the PBS architecture to enhance decentralization by separating actor roles, it remains unclear whether its design is optimal. Implicit trust assumptions and conflicts of interest may benefit particular parties and foster the need for vertical integration. MEV-Boost was explicitly designed to foster decentralization, causing the side effect of enabling risk-free sandwich extraction from unsuspecting users, potentially raising concerns for regulators."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16468v2

While DeFi comes with high rewards, it also carries plenty of risks. Many financial crimes have occurred over the years making the early detection of malicious activity an issue of high priority. The proposed framework introduces an effective method for extracting a set of features from different chains, including the largest one, Ethereum and it is evaluated over an extensive dataset we gathered with the transactions of the most widely used DeFi protocols (23 in total, including Aave, Compound, Curve, Lido, and Yearn) based on a novel dataset in collaboration with Covalent.

Every cryptocurrency must have an associated Blockchain. Blockchain is a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) which supports cryptocurrencies, this may be considered as the most promising disruptive technology in the industry 4.0 context. Decentralized finance (DeFi) is a Blockchain-based financial infrastructure, the term generally refers to an open, permissionless, and highly interoperable protocol stack built on public smart contract platforms, such as the Ethereum Blockchain. It replicates existing financial services in a more open and transparent way. DeFi does not rely on intermediaries and centralized institutions. Instead, it is based on open protocols and decentralized applications (Dapps). Considering that there are many digital coins, stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), these currencies should interact among each other sometime. For this interaction the Information Technology elements play an important whole as enablers and IT strategic alignment. This paper considers the strategic alignment model proposed by Henderson and Venkatraman (1993) and Luftman (1996). This paper seeks to answer two main questions 1) What are the common IT elements in the DeFi? And 2) How the elements connect to the IT strategic alignment in DeFi? Through a Systematic Literature Review (SLR). Results point out that there are many IT elements already mentioned by literature, however there is a lack in the literature about the connection between IT elements and IT strategic alignment in a Decentralized Finance (DeFi) architectural network.

This article explores the development of a backtesting framework specifically tailored for concentrated liquidity market makers (CLMM). The focus is on leveraging the liquidity distribution approximated using a parametric model, to estimate the rewards within liquidity pools.   The article details the design, implementation, and insights derived from this novel approach to backtesting within the context of Uniswap V3. The developed backtester was successfully utilized to assess reward levels across several pools using historical data from 2023 (pools Uniswap v3 for pairs of altcoins, stablecoins and USDC/ETH with different fee levels). Moreover, the error in modeling the level of rewards for the period under review for each pool was less than 1\%. This demonstrated the effectiveness of the backtester in quantifying liquidity pool rewards and its potential in estimating LP's revenues as part of the pool rewards, as focus of our next research.   The backtester serves as a tool to simulate trading strategies and liquidity provision scenarios, providing a quantitative assessment of potential returns for liquidity providers (LP). By incorporating statistical tools to mirror CLMM pool liquidity dynamics, this framework can be further leveraged for strategy enhancement and risk evaluation for LPs operating within decentralized exchanges."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09983v1
Time-Varying Bidirectional Causal Relationships Between Transaction Fees   and Economic Activity of Subsystems Utilizing the Ethereum Blockchain Network                , "Lennart Ante, Aman Saggu"                                                                                                                                                        , 2025-01-09T15:03:05Z, "The Ethereum blockchain network enables transaction processing and smart-contract execution through levies of transaction fees, commonly known as gas fees. This framework mediates economic participation via a market-based mechanism for gas fees, permitting users to offer higher gas fees to expedite pro-cessing. Historically, the ensuing gas fee volatility led to critical disequilibria between supply and demand for block space, presenting stakeholder challenges. This study examines the dynamic causal interplay between transaction fees and economic subsystems leveraging the network. By utilizing data related to unique active wallets and transaction volume of each subsystem and applying time-varying Granger causality analysis, we reveal temporal heterogeneity in causal relationships between economic activity and transaction fees across all subsystems. This includes (a) a bidirectional causal feedback loop between cross-blockchain bridge user activity and transaction fees, which diminishes over time, potentially signaling user migration; (b) a bidirectional relationship between centralized cryptocurrency exchange deposit and withdrawal transaction volume and fees, indicative of increased competition for block space; (c) decentralized exchange volumes causally influence fees, while fees causally influence user activity, although this relationship is weakening, potentially due to the diminished significance of decentralized finance; (d) intermittent causal relationships with maximal extractable value bots; (e) fees causally in-fluence non-fungible token transaction volumes; and (f) a highly significant and growing causal influence of transaction fees on stablecoin activity and transaction volumes highlight its prominence."                                                                                                                                                                            , http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05299v1

We present GoldMine OS, a research oriented architecture that employs multiple specialized AI agents to automate and secure the tokenization and exchange of physical gold into a blockchain based stablecoin (""OZ""). Our approach combines on chain smart contracts for critical risk controls with off chain AI agents for decision making, blending the transparency and reliability of blockchains with the flexibility of AI driven automation. We describe four cooperative agents (Compliance, Token Issuance, Market Making, and Risk Control) and a coordinating core, and evaluate the system through simulation and a controlled pilot deployment. In experiments the prototype delivers on demand token issuance in under 1.2 s, more than 100 times faster than manual workflows. The Market Making agent maintains tight liquidity with spreads often below 0.5 percent even under volatile conditions. Fault injection tests show resilience: an oracle price spoofing attack is detected and mitigated within 10 s, and a simulated vault mis reporting halts issuance immediately with minimal user impact. The architecture scales to 5000 transactions per second with 10000 concurrent users in benchmarks. These results indicate that an AI agent based decentralized exchange for alternative assets can satisfy rigorous performance and safety requirements. We discuss broader implications for democratizing access to traditionally illiquid assets and explain how our governance model -- multi signature agent updates and on chain community voting on risk parameters -- provides ongoing transparency, adaptability, and formal assurance of system integrity."                                                                    , http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11117v1

As closed clubs, much of the general public has been excluded from participation. But the vast majority of private sector actors consists of micro or small firms that are vulnerable to late payments and generally ineligible for bank loans. This low liquidity environment often results in gridlock and leads to insolvency, and it disproportionately impacts small enterprises and communities.   On the other hand, blockchain communities have developed open, decentralized settlement systems, along with a proliferation of store of value assets and new lending protocols, allowing anyone to permissionlessly transact and access credit. However, these protocols remain used primarily for speculative purposes, and so far have fallen short of the large-scale positive impact on the real economy prophesied by their promoters.   We address these challenges by introducing Cycles, an open, decentralized clearing, settlement, and issuance protocol. Cycles is designed to enable firms to overcome payment inefficiencies, to reduce their working capital costs, and to leverage diverse assets and liquidity sources, including cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and lending protocols, in service of clearing more debt with less money. Cycles solves real world liquidity challenges through a privacy-preserving multilateral settlement platform based on a graph optimization algorithm. The design is based on a core insight: liquidity resides within cycles in the payment network's structure and can be accessed via settlement flows optimized to reduce debt."                                                                                                                                        , http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22309v1

We study this treasury problem as a continuous-time control task with two instruments: reallocating reserves between cash and short-duration government bills, and setting a spread fee for either minting or burning the coin. Mint and redemption flows follow mutually exciting processes that reproduce clustered order flow; peg deviations arise when redemptions exceed liquid reserves within settlement windows. We develop a stochastic model predictive control framework that incorporates moment closure for event intensities. Using Pontryagin's Maximum Principle, we demonstrate that the optimal control exhibits a bang-off-bang structure: each asset type is purchased at maximum capacity when the utility difference exceeds the corresponding difference in shadow costs. Introducing settlement windows leads to a sampled-data implementation with a simple threshold (soft-thresholding) structure for rebalancing. We also establish a monotone stress-response property: as expected outflows intensify or windows lengthen, the optimal policy shifts predictably toward cash. In simulations covering various stress test scenarios, the controller preserves most bill carry in calm markets, builds cash quickly when stress emerges, and avoids unnecessary rotations under transitory signals. The proposed policy is implementation-ready and aligns naturally with operational cut-offs. Our results translate empirical flow risk into auditable treasury rules that improve peg quality without sacrificing avoidable carry."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09429v1

Exeum proposes a novel method to provide price stable digital tokens whose values are pegged to real world assets, serving as a bridge between the real world and the decentralized economy.   Pegged tokens issued by Exeum - for example, USDE refers to a stable token issued by the system whose value is pegged to USD - are backed by virtual assets in a virtual asset exchange where users can deposit the base token of the system and take long or short positions. Guaranteeing the stability of the pegged tokens boils down to the problem of maintaining the peg of the virtual assets to real world assets, and the main mechanism used by Exeum is controlling the swap rate of assets. If the swap rate is fully controlled by the system, arbitrageurs can be incentivized enough to restore a broken peg; Exeum distributes statistical arbitrage trading software to decentralize this type of market making activity. The last major component of the system is a central bank equivalent that determines the long term interest rate of the base token, pays interest on the deposit by inflating the supply if necessary, and removes the need for stability fees on pegged tokens, improving their usability.   To the best of our knowledge, Exeum is the first to propose a truly decentralized method for developing a stablecoin that enables 1:1 value conversion between the base token and pegged assets, completely removing the mismatch between supply and demand. In this paper, we will also discuss its applications, such as improving staking based DApp token models, price stable gas fees, pegging to an index of DApp tokens, and performing cross-chain asset transfer of legacy crypto assets.", http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03482v1

However, today's token economies are largely designed without infrastructure systems in mind, and often operate with a fixed token supply (e.g., Bitcoin). This paper argues that token economies for infrastructure networks should be structured differently - they should continually incentivize new suppliers to join the network to provide services and support to the ecosystem. As such, the associated token rewards should gracefully scale with the size of the decentralized system, but should be carefully balanced with consumer demand to manage inflation and be designed to ultimately reach an equilibrium. To achieve such an equilibrium, the decentralized token economy should be adaptable and controllable so that it maximizes the total utility of all users, such as achieving stable (overall non-inflationary) token economies.   Our main contribution is to model infrastructure token economies as dynamical systems - the circulating token supply, price, and consumer demand change as a function of the payment to nodes and costs to consumers for infrastructure services. Crucially, this dynamical systems view enables us to leverage tools from mathematical control theory to optimize the overall decentralized network's performance. Moreover, our model extends easily to a Stackelberg game between the controller and the nodes, which we use for robust, strategic pricing. In short, we develop predictive, optimization-based controllers that outperform traditional algorithmic stablecoin heuristics by up to $2.4 \times$ in simulations based on real demand data from existing decentralized wireless networks."                                                          , http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12881v1
